## Assignment 1
This program performs text processing on a employee dataset to centralize the formatting of the first name, last name, middle inital, employee id, and phone number. The program uses regex for pattern matching and data validation. The program uses a person class to save the people in the dataset and saves them in a dictionary that is then saved in a pickle file. Finally, the employee list is displayed to the user.
