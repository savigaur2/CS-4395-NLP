# Assignment 1 Details

## Program description
This program performs text processing on a employee dataset to centralize the formatting of the first name, last name, middle inital, employee id, and phone number. The program uses regex for pattern matching and data validation. The program uses a person class to save the people in the dataset and saves them in a dictionary that is then saved in a pickle file. Finally, the employee list is displayed to the user.

## How to run the program
The program can be run by the command line using the follwoing command: ```python3 Homework1_sxg180113.py data/data.csv```. The argument ```data/data.csv``` is the file path of the data file used in the program.

## Strenghts/weaknesses of Python for text processing
I think that there alot of strengths to suing Python for text analysis. There are great libraries for pattern mathicng like ```re``` for regex pattern mathcing and ```nltk``` for NLP analysis, which wasnt used in this program. Also writing code in Python is much faster and cleaner in my opinion than other languages like C++ and Java. One downside is that sometimes Python code can take some time to run since it is an interpreted language.

## What I learned from this assignment
In this assignment, I learned how to sue regex to perfrom pattern matching. I never used regex in my educational or professional career, so using it in this assignment was a good introduction. Also, I never worked with pickle files or object oriented programming in Python before, so this assignment was good practice for OOP and pickling file processing as well.
