# Assignment 3 Details

## Program description
This program performs text processing on the ```anat19.txt``` file read in by command line arguments. This file is the text from one chapter of an anatomy textbook. The program calculates the lexical diversityof the tokens in the file, displays the lemmas, performs part-of-speech tagging, and displays the nouns present in the text. Next, the program presents the user with an interactive hangman guessing game based on the words from the text file. This game gives the user 5 points to start adn everytime they guess a letter correct, they gain one point, and everytime they guess a letter incorrect, they lose one point. The gane ends either when the user guess the word completely, the user has negative points, or if the user guesses a ```!```.

## How to run the program
The program can be run by the command line using the follwoing command: ```python3 Homework3_sxg180113.py data/anat19.csv```. The argument ```data/anat19.csv``` is the file path of the data file used in the program.

## What I learned from this assignment
In this assignment, I learned how to work with raw text files and perform analysis on them. Specifically, I learned how to calculate lexical diversity, perform part-of-speach tagging, and filter word-tag pairs on certain conditions. Additionally, I got a review on how to program game/user submission loops using Python and manipulate variables used in a game.
