# Text Classification Details

## Program Description
This program attempts to predict spam or ham (not spam) text messages using Deep Learning. The program first preprocesses the data by tokenizing and vectorizing it. Then, the performance of 4 models is comapred: Sequential, RNN, GRU and CNN. Finally, an analysis of the results is given, describing the performance of the 4 models.

## How to run the proram
The program is a .ipynb file which can be run by simply running all code cells.

## What I learned from this assignment
In this asignment I learned how to tokenize and vecotrize text data in practice. I also learned how to develop deep learning models such as Sequential, RNN, GRU and CNN and that the small details about the input and output shape of the data being feed to and from the layers of each model is very important.
