family and friends—until the moment they find the mirrors in their bedrooms are shining.At a single touch, they are pulled from their lonely lives into a wondrous castle straight out of a Grimm's fairy tale.This whimsical place, oddly lacking in food and running water but full of electrical sockets, is home to a petulant girl in a mask, named Wolf Queen and becomes their playground and refuge during school hours.Hidden within the walls, they're told there's a key that will grant one wish, as well as a set of clues to find it.But there's a catch: the key must be found by the end of the school year and they must leave the premises by five o'clock each day or else suffer a fatal end.As time passes, a devastating truth emerges: only those brave enough to share their stories will be saved.And so they begin to unlock each other's stories: how a boy is showered with more gadgets than love; how another suffers a painful and unexplained rejection, and how a girl lives in fear of her predatory stepfather.As they struggle to abide by the rules of the game, a moving story unfolds, of seven characters trapped in a cycle of misunderstanding and loneliness, who are ultimately set free by the power of friendship, empathy, and sacrifice.(Source: Erewhon Books, edited)StudioA-1 PicturesSourceNovelN/A        8.2K        Add to ListBokura no Yoake4026020221021Bokura no YoakeOct 21,
