      Joined: Jan 2017        Posts: 3056        How to Participate in the 2022 RPG Adventure!This year there are 133 total challenge items.Depending on the difficulty you choose, you will complete up to 75 total items.Each level will require you to complete a certain number of items.Within those items, you will also need to complete a minimum number of "Quests":🗺️    Level 1　 =　 Complete a total of 20 challenge items, including at least 1 fully completed Quest🗺️🗡️    Level 2　 =　 35 items, including 2 full Quests🗺️🗡️⚗️    Level 3　 =　 50 items, including 3 full Quests🗺️🗡️⚗️⚔️    Level 4　 =　 65 items, including 4 full Quests🗺️🗡️⚗️⚔️🐲    Level 5　 =　 75 items, including 5 full QuestsIntroductionThis year the entire item list is open to all users from the very start!No tiers, no pre-made cards to stick to; you can complete any of the challenge items in any order you want!Decide what Level you would like to reach.Complete the total number of challenge items required by your chosen Level.Depending on your Level, you will also need to choose which Quests you want to complete.What is a Quest?A "Quest" is a group of 5-10 challenge items that have a similar style or theme.For example: all the items in Quest F involve searching for anime with specific Source materials, while Quest M is all about anime titles.How do I complete a Quest?Simply complete all the challenge items in that Quest.Items you complete in a Quest count toward the total number of items required for your difficulty.For example: if you're attempting Level 3, you need to complete 50 total items and at least 3 Quests over the course of your challenge.Let's say you complete all the items in Quests A (9 items), M (8 items), and R (7 items).That means you've already completed 24 items.The remaining 26 items can be a mix of anything from your leftover Quests.Can I complete more than the required number of Quests?Yes.You may complete more Quests than your Level requires, but you may not complete more items than your Level requires.Signing Up & Completing Challenge ItemsScroll down this page to find the post titled "Sign-Up Code".Click the "Show Sign-Up Code" button in the post to view the BBCode,

brackets, on a new line below the anime title.You can decide if you want your challenge inspected or not and if you want to try for Legendary.In the same manner you can decide if, after your

later on during January/February, depending on the first ones to turn in.Tips for Checking Challenge before Turning-inMake sure that all dates have been filled out with brackets on both ends and are in a consistent format.Example: if your (A1) Start Date is Jan 01, make sure the rest follow this format.All listed anime should have the same title as its MAL main title.This includes all punctuation.For example: "Working!!!"should include the !!!at the end.Similarly, titles like "Houseki no Kuni (TV)" and "Appleseed (Movie)" should include the bit in parentheses as well.Do not copy the anime title from the URL - "Uta_no☆Prince-sama♪__Maji_Love_1000" is not correct; it should be "Uta no☆Prince-sama♪: Maji Love 1000%"All anime used must have their page's link properly entered.All extra information and screenshot links (if applicable) should be in square brackets, on a separate line below the anime's title.Items that require this will have an extra line already provided where you will enter any necessary information.If an item does not have an extra line provided but you would like to add extra information, use the other items as an example of what it should look like.Make sure to provide all of the information requested on each item that needs it.InvalidsWhat happens if I have an invalid item after turning in?If during the inspection of your challenge we find an invalid (an anime that doesn't fit the item requirements), you will be asked to either:Use the same item and replace the invalid anime with a valid one watched during your challenge period.Watch a new anime as a replacement after your Challenge Finish Date (date of the last watched anime for the challenge).Keep in mind that the replacement is for the same item where you had the invalid.Use the same anime and move it to a previously unused item from the challenge item list.IMPORTANT: If moving the anime to a different item would cause your total number of completed Quests to drop below the minimum required for your Level, then you cannot use this option.If you have invalids, you may choose to shuffle anime around within your challenge to make them valid, within reason.If you do this, you MUST make sure to let us know what changes were made or we will not be able to validate the corrections.Withdrawing from the ChallengeIf you make a post in the thread and later decide you do not want to participate, do not delete your post, as this will affect the rest of the posts/links.Please use the following method to withdraw from the challenge.Before withdrawing, it's suggested that you
