             Creative                  Preliminary        Spoiler  Shingeki no Kyojin(Manga)add        (All reviews)      Apr 8, 2021VetmiNot Recommended                 *This review contains spoilers*Ladies and Gentlemen, Hello.My name is Hajime Isayama and today I'll teach you how to write manga.I must begin by saying that you should not be discouraged.At first glance, it can be difficult, but you only have to write 90 chapters perfectly tied together, with great characters and mystery to the world and titans, fantastic fights that actually serve a purpose with barely any talk no jutsu moments, and perhaps the single most important thing in all of this, Sasha being alive.What you ought to do afterward is write a timeskip.This is meant for the end-series so we can                  ...have a "where are they now" segment but there is no need to worry about it because another timeskip will occur in the last chapter as we would have the pleasure of seeing in efficiency how terrible Eren's plan was.The first timeskip is primarily meant as a means of showing Eren becoming this evil incarnate that at no point in the series have we gotten hits about such alteration to his character.The second one is instead a quick reminder of how Yams got worse at writing a proper story without contrivance to its characters.Both are meant for Eren as he's convinced that all lives must be taken in order to obtain "freedom" and in doing so he ought to go against his friends causing an artificial conflict between him and the rest of Paradis as well countless third parties in which for entirely redundant reasons will join Paradis side and go against Eren.From this point onwards, you don't have to write anything decent since it will all depend on which character is to your liking the most and you'll always have to make him or her achieve whatever goal they are in need of.In this case, it's Armin.He's mastered the talk no Jutsu, I dare to say it's his strongest technique.Anyone he's talked to has been convinced to help him do whatever he's wanted to and its limits know no bounds.With the power of friendship, Armin doesn't give up, not for one moment while he and co-venture towards Eren to stop him but first, we must go a bit before all that because you are clearly asking how all those characters have joined the Paradis side.Because of plot device, they ultimately were there because Eren too changed sides and there was no choice but to help their enemies.The two couldn't stay on one side only since that wouldn't make sense, just like it doesn't make any sense for Reiner, Pieck, and others to help Armin and Mikasa, meant solely as an excuse for "redemption" for some of the characters.Armin succeeds because of course, he did, Eren becomes dove because of course, he did, we never learn much about the titans and the few things we get to throw at us are pure nonsense in an asspull way upon the "paths" was introduced into the story which, for all intents and purposes is the main reason why the second arc of the timeskip is this bad.Historia getting sidelined from the story by getting pregnant off of some random farmer we never know anything about, which it's not the fact the child is not Eren's that pissed me off, but rather that she could've done so much that being someone's whore.To top it all, Eren Lelouch'd his ass out of and acts like he did something important or useful when all he did was fight for something he himself committed.I always knew he was going to do that the moment he becomes evil for the greater good but never wanted to believe it as I knew it wouldn't work with the story itself.All the troubles Eren went through, all the people he killed, were just for his friends to live happily ever after.Instead of removing the titan course and finishing what he initially wanted to, he follows the most bullshit route and makes peace for a few generations... slightly for his friends to live their miserable life in complete serenity and with this in mind, the descendants to be inevitably killed.There is no point in taking so many lives when everything remains the same and what Eren has fought so far becomes useless because his goal was suddenly retconned when he confessed his "love" to Mikasa all of a sudden.Especially when you murdered 80% of the population and would've taken a mere couple of hours to exterminate the rest and finally be free of the burden.Even if Eren had somehow died because of that, it's still a better outcome of what we've got although it needs to once again be mentioned that what led to that would've been abominable regardless.It can't get out of character than this, and it makes no sense either given how Mikasa got to suck Horse's dick anyway.I wonder what Dove-Eren must've felt when he saw Mikasa getting fucked by the only person he didn't want to fuck her.I bet it's not sitting well with him."Thank you Eren for turning yourself into a mass-murder for our sake"If you want more proof that Armin is the most hateful character, here you go.Eren is the worst character, but Armin is someone you would hate the moment he opens his mouth.When Armin mastered the talk-no-Jutsu it was as clear as day that he was going to succeed in convincing all of the previous enemies into joining his side to take down Eren, which he does, and that he had a plan into making Eren stop but think about it, why would Eren stop and how would Armin make that happen?Apparently, Armin never thought about the consequences, and the whole reason why he did all that in the first place was that it was against genocide, that there had to be a better option to put an end to this and in the last chapter he goes "Thank you for killing all them fuckers".What could have possibly happened between his determination to stop Eren and the last chapter that made him accept Eren's behavior and get along with everything he's done?Armin who is not only the brain of the trio, but was always been morally right, and looking back at everything he's always made the right and acceptable decision to put an end to something but in the last chapter he comes across as disingenuous and a piece of shit with virtually no fucking reason that let him to the settlement.As for tradition, a good lead female in shonen is hard to come by and Mikasa is no exception.You won't certainly hate her as much as Eren and Armin but will sure get on your nerves with her stoic persona throughout.In the early series, she's got something to work with and her strength was admirable so for all the good reasons she was reliable in that department.I always liked her early on but looking back it's clear Yams either didn't care much about her or perhaps wasn't able to give her more stuff to do as the story went on, which I find extremely odd given how in the post timeskip she was suddenly given more importance than before but ended up being a leftover until the last two chapters gaining the determination to do the thing she should have done a long time ago.Mikasa is a bit awesome in her own way, but she has no ambitions of any kind and comes across as Eren's shadow.It is clear that she has had mental issues since she was a kid from the accident she and Eren had and her affection for Eren is due to this, but Yams does not look into this with the possibility that she may recover one day.Eren seemingly hating her was an excuse to make her grow and act on her own rather than following in his footsteps but she does nothing the entire time besides feeling sad at Eren's sentiments towards her because Yams never gave a shit about her.I haven't talked about the rest of the characters but really, what there is to talk about?They all suck because the writing sucks and the story shifted from average (Marley) to the worst thing (War for Paradis) in a dozen or so chapters and it destroys everyone's solid characterization they once had.The transition from Eren becoming evil and after meeting Ymir was awful and the premise itself was bad, to begin with, because it didn't build up to characters that would eventually join the Paradis side to defeat a common enemy.It does this by assuming that everyone is fine in the first place, while that couldn't be feasible in any way.Yams wanted to give the characters more depth but clearly couldn't work with the way they were presented in the first place and also goes against their characters as previously they wanted to defeat Eren as quickly as possible without taking out everyone and yet waste time for trivial stuff.A "goal" of any of the characters who weren't on Eren's side, vanish because the final moments of the story is them trying to reach and take down Eren and in the midst of all the chaos down there, it's impossible to get any devolvement, and they don't, so Yams had to put Floch as a mini-boss before the final event as a means of showing the "cooperation" of the two sides of which couldn't work but the shitty writing proved me otherwise.Which is better, the journey or the destination?The answer is both.But can everyone get that luxury?Unfortunately not.What one must do to get near to said luxury?Make the journey be worth the destination.If the AoT story had followed this thought of mine, it would've made sense.What was only needed is a linear thread to follow and find its end without splitting into different directions because you wanted to make it a more compelling approach to your story.You could, but why risk it when you had the answer right in the palm of your hand?Eren died a virgin.That's all you need to know!Reviewer’s Rating: 1What did you think of this review?Nice              0              Love it              0              Funny              0

                                   Story - 9.38The first three volumes may discourage some of the readers because it's starts off kind of slow and the initial artwork is not quite up to today's standards.However, after the reader begins the Golden Age arc it is nearly impossible to not be pulled in and become addicted to the series.It is chock-full of action, drama, character development, twists and turns, and just a dash of romance.It defies generalization and is just damn good storytelling.After the Gold Age arc wraps up the story come back full circle to where it left us at the end of volume 3.But by                  ...then the rhythm of the manga has changed completely.The reader has established a deep connection with Guts, Casca, and Griffith and that only grows more as the story continues.You'll be confronted with conflicting emotions and think things like &quot;I really want to see Guts put Griffith in the ground&quot; and at the same time &quot;Griffith is just so damn cool&quot;.These conflicting thoughts and emotions just go to show how invested the reader becomes with the characters.Another good thing about the Berserk story is that the protagonist (Guts) is not always the focal character in every chapter.In fact, nearly all of the major supporting cast members receive a considerable amount of page space for their own stories to be fleshed out.Each of these side-stories is not only unique and extremely well developed, but also very deep and revealing as it shows the reader why these character are the way they are.One of the side stories that I found most intriguing was Farnese and Serpico's as it was so beautifully orchestrated as part of the manga as a whole.The only problem with the story, in my humble opinion, is the introduction of magic in the manga.I feel that the magic the group &quot;acquires&quot; in volume 24 is somewhat exaggerated and does not suit the dark atmosphere of the story.In fact, at times it can even make some of the chapters feel a bit shounen-esk.But even still, it's pretty much impossible not to enjoy the ongoing story that is Berserk.Art - 9.6The artwork in the first few volumes of Berserk won't do much to impress many of today's manga readers, but at the time when the series was first serialized (1992) it was certainly well above average.Those initial volumes feature many very unique character designs (especially the apostles) and also sport a relatively high focus on detail.However, where Miura really shows off his latent artistic talents early on is through his ability to create crisp, clear, and highly fluid fight scenes.One of the few negative aspects of the early volumes can be identified as the simple shading techniques that Miura used.Also, sometimes the character faces will look just a bit &quot;off&quot; and it can be a little distracting.However, these minor quality issues were most likely due to the time constraints that were in place at the time and not entirely the fault of the artist.Then as the series progresses the reader gets to watch the artwork literally evolve.As we learn more and more about the characters and the world in which they live, the characters themselves and their environments become more and more visually detailed.The simple shading from the early volumes is eventually replaced by a hand shading technique which gives the series a more gritty and surreal overall feeling.The character designs become more crisp and facial expressions sometimes are so vivid that one look at a character's face is often enough to tell the reader exactly what the character is thinking.By the time the reader makes it into volumes 20 and beyond Miura has made it very clear that he means for Berserk to be truly regarded as a work of art just as much as it is a masterfully epic piece of storytelling.In my own experience I have seen very, very few other manga series that can even approach Berserk's later volumes on an artistic level and, unfortunately, I highly doubt that I will ever be able to find its peer.Characters - 9.5The very first character you will meet in Berserk is Guts, the &quot;Black Swordsman&quot; with a dark past and a score to settle with his demonic enemies.Certainly not a very revolutionary character at first glance, but even though he may start off as such, his character quickly expands, and ends up as one of the most believable and human characters I have ever witnessed.As the story unwinds, you follow Guts through his past, allowing you to experience his personality change during his constant battle against fate.You follow Guts through waves of despair and hardships offset only by the flickering fires of friendship and trust.Eventually, Guts becomes like a maelstrom of opposing emotions, and the question arises, will he continue on his path of all-consuming revenge even if it means losing everything he has come to care for?The other characters that appear throughout the course of the story come in all different shapes and sizes and all play their roles perfectly, just as support characters should.The more important support characters, protagonists and antagonists alike, are all draped in many layers of depth, making their characters both solid pillars and interesting ingredients within the plot as a whole.From Griffith's burning ambition to the skulduggery of the God Hand, from Puck and Isidro's antics to Farnese's troubled past and uncertain future, the characters all appear vivid and alive (Although alive might not fit The Skull Knight...) and all have their own emotions, personalities and ambitions.The supportive cast show their brilliance in how they appear to the reader as actual players in Berserk's grand game, and not just as passive plot devices.With such a cast of strong personalities and vibrant, living characters, Berserk easily cuts it's way (no pun intended) to the top score in this category.Enjoyment - 10The fact that I sat and read through all 295 chapters of this exquisite manga in one sitting should justify the perfect score for enjoyment!The manga has great characters - heroes you root for and empathize with, villains you can't help but admire for their ruthlessness and charisma.The artwork is dark, brooding, and gruesome and complements the story well.And what a riveting story it is...It hooks you from the first chapter and sets the stage for the most intriguing revenge themed manga on the market.Its success is testament to its quality.My only complaint is the excruciating waits between chapters.Also, I must throw in a cautionary note: this manga is quite definitely not for the faint hearted.There is a considerable amount nudity, sex, gore, violence, and, for the lack of a better word, bad-assery!OVERALL - 9.69This review is

                (574/?chp)                                                   Frequently categorized with both Bleach and Naruto as one of the Shonen Big Three, One Piece is a romantic tale of pirates, treasures  ...talking reindeer, panties, flying skeletons, Takoyaki selling Octopuses, and oceans roaming with Sea Monsters the size of which can take down fleets of ships.Crazy enough for you?This is the world of One Piece.Being categorized with Bleach and Naruto, on the surface this might strike an unfamiliar reader as another generic uncreative Shonen series; but truthfully, comparing One Piece to Bleach and Naruto would be like comparing Disney World to an elementary school playground.If these three series are the                  ...big three, then One Piece would be the boss sitting on a lavish chair smoking a cigarette, while Bleach and Naruto would be the two henchmen standing side by side of the boss and nodding at everything he says.Story:Set during the Golden Age of Pirates, the story follows Monkey D Luffy as he sets sail with his crew to conquer the sea which is inhabited by formidable pirates who all aim to become the Pirate King, the Grand Line and claim the treasures of 'One Piece' left by the late Pirate King, Gol D Roger.Of course the goal of being Pirate King really is just a loose objective set forward that eventually throws Luffy and his shipmates into a giant boiling pot full of problems and adventures.What's special about this story is that it takes the most run-of-the-mill concepts and turns it into something fantastic and exciting.The concept of traveling from drastically different locations after locations is filled with endlessly creative characters and creatures that sets it apart from ever being dull, as opposed to say, Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle where traveling to new worlds is a borefest and you can only hope the next world is interesting, and well if it's not ...have fun reading an entire arc on that filled with recycled characters.The main plot device used in One Piece are the Devil Fruits, which grant anyone that eats them inhuman powers though at the deadly price of sinking like an anchor in the water; here the strange irony being that this is a series about pirates constantly on water.What makes this concept actually interesting is that every fruit has a different power and no two powers are the same, and Oda's endless imagination to come up with strange and hilarious powers.Above that, what makes this concept better than say, Bankai's or Kekkei Genkai's, is that you never know how two powers match up, so the weakest Devil Fruit powers in the current arc could very well be the key factor to winning a battle in the next, in that way, none of the characters ever seem so overpowered that they can completely destroy the other characters and it certainly adds an air of suspension and excitement to the battles that you wouldn't find in something like Sasuke vs. Konohamaru.The story of One Piece may be simple and often straight out silly at times, but if you read deep enough, you'll realize that oftentimes the stories are much deeper and well-crafted than you would think they are, from the spark of a rebellion through misunderstandings to the questioning of an unfair God, One Piece can often surprise you through the story.One of the great things about One Piece when it comes to the story is that it's unpredictable, you never know where a fight is going, what's going to happen to the characters, who's going to win and who's going to turn out to be a good guy and who's going to be a bad guy, it's this element that makes everything that happens so intriguing and an extremely fun read.Another well-done part of the story is that the stories of the characters are all intertwined so that it doesn't seem like the only thing holding all these characters together is through the main protagonist, the main antagonist of one arc may very well know the supporting ally of the next, and that just contributes to a more interesting read.Another strong point of the story is that Oda isn't afraid to bring back old characters, be it enemies or comical side characters and villains, they aren't just cut out of the story once their arc is over, they come back, some as allies and friends, this, in a sense, really fleshes out the One Piece world and makes the reader feel that the world does not revolve around The Straw Hat Pirates, but instead, the pirates of the Grand Line, all in all, it adds a sense of dimension to the story and makes it feel not as linear as it could be in the hands of a less skilled mangaka.But what ultimately makes the story of One Piece so grand and exciting is thanks to two major components: 1) the emotional depth, and 2), Oda's masterful storytelling.The emotional depth in this series is amazing and can oftentimes leave one speechless, from the simple departure of a character to join the Straw Hats to the rescue of a friend in need, it's not emotionally complex ...it's just plain raw emotion of wanting to be loved or the sadness of losing a friend yet it achieves such a level of pure emotion and excitement that the likes of Bleach and Naruto can only dream of achieving.Now the second component that makes One Piece great is how Oda tells the story, he can build up the story to the point where you can feel the urgency, the sense of despair, and the feeling of something great happening.He creates cliffhangers, yet never makes it irritatingly frustrating, he inserts flashbacks, yet they never feel out of place or annoying to read, and the way he builds up the fights is just, for the lack of better worlds, epic.People say Gurren Lagann is exciting, well I'd like to see those TTGL fans have a taste of what it feels as the Straw Hats infiltrate Enies Lobby or when The Eleven Supernovas gather at Sabaody Archipelago.Combine this with the perfect blend of humor (this manga is absolutely hilarious) and the sheer creativity of Oda and you got yourself an adventure of unequaled proportions.Art:The bad thing with the art is that Oda's action sequences are so fast-paced and ambitious that it often times becomes muddled and a bit too messy; it gets hard to tell what's happening in these fight scenes and it takes a bit of imagination to understand what Oda is trying to do with these fight scenes, or else they come off rather cheesy at times, such as Luffy's Gomu Gomu no Gatling or Zoro's Kiki Kyūtōryū: Ashura.The good on the other hand outweigh the bad of the art through the creative character designs that Oda just never seems to run out of, even if it's a character that appears in one panel and may never show up again, the utmost attention is given to his/her design so they never appear out of place compared to the other crazy designs he gives his characters.From the Okama Mr. 2 to the CP9 crew, the characters are all so different in appearance, size, and demeanor, it's hard to imagine how Oda keeps up.The sheer variability of the Straw Hat crew itself is a primary example of what a creative mangaka Oda is, as opposed to the recycled designs of his peers, Kishimoto and Kubo.Be it skeleton, reindeer, cyborg or witch, anyone and everyone is a likely candidate for the Straw Hat crew.Aside from character designs, Oda really make the scenes feel cinematic and exciting, the tension and the sheer majestic and romantic quality of the adventure of the Straw Hats would never be fantastic without Oda's use of great art, from the crew getting ready to bombard Arlong Park to the storming of Enies Lobby, the examples go on.In short, Oda really knows how to pump you up through his art.Lastly, the exaggerated expressions sometimes are just downright hilarious.I swear I laughed my ass off for at least five minutes when Enel made that huge WTF face after confronting Luffy.Character:This is where One Piece is particularly strong in, and where this series shine at its greatest.One Piece's cast is colorful, hilarious, and unpredictable.Currently, the Straw Hat crew consists of a rubber man, a pirate hunting pirate, a thief, a long nosed sniper, a womanizing cook, a transforming reindeer, a "witch", a cyborg that doesn't wear pants, and a walking skeleton.Yep.Each character is unique, and when you throw a bunch like them together, the chemistry and interaction between the Straw Hat crew is comedic gold.And while they are almost always fooling around, each Straw Hat member has their own back stories that truly make them much deeper than what they appear to be at first.Brook is not just a joke character for variety, Nami is not just there to act like the straight man, Luffy isn't always a senseless fool, and Robin isn't just there to act like a damsel in distress (okay maybe she is ...kidding).The thing that needs to be pointed out is that the Straw Hat crew is a complex cast that is often much deeper than meets the eye.Outside the crew, both the friends the Straw Hat meet and the villains they confront are so freshly colorful and original, it never gets boring.The Shichibukai are just a perfect example of the variety of the One Piece cast, as well as CP9 and of course, Baroque Works.I would say it's pretty hard to find another cast so distinctive and creative as One Piece's.Of course the Devil Fruits certainly help in bringing the characters to life.Like previously mentioned, a strong point of the characters is how connected they are.The connections between characters are complex and can get pretty surprising sometimes.Who may appear as an old man could very well be friends with the former Pirate King and that whale that you saw at that mountain?Oh he's related to a guy you'll meet up with in a couple of hundred chapters.Some authors pull this kind of stuff out of nowhere (see: Kishimoto), but Oda plans out these kind of relations so intricately and carefully, you can't help but be impressed.Are there weak points to the characters?Certainly, there's a storyline that seems awfully repeated for the female crew-members of the Straw Hats, but the scale of the story is so big, that in the end, it doesn't matter that much and that one little slip-up never seemed like a big deal to begin with.Enjoyment:This is the most enjoyable manga I have ever read.It's an absolute pleasure to read.Are there dull parts?At the beginning of every arc, there is always some exposition to be done, but once things enter full swing (and that is rather fast), damn, the chapters fly by in the hundreds, this is crack in manga form.If you want to know, I have spent entire days reading One Piece, that is how addicting this stuff is.With One Piece breaking records in sales in Japan, I think it speaks for itself when it comes to enjoyment.Overall:One Piece is my favorite manga.Period.The story is such a grand and epic adventure, with each arc topping the previous; the characters are so tear-inducingly hilarious, and the art is so cinematic and exciting, One Piece is without the doubt, the greatest Shonen manga I've ever had the pleasure of reading, and I doubt it will be topped anytime soon, if ever, as my favorite manga series.Cheers to Oda for creating this Shonen masterpiece, and may he continue to keep on going, One Piece is a manga that I love and hope to read for many many many years to come.Yohohoho a pirate's life for me~        Reviewer’s Rating: 10What did you think of this review?Nice              0              Love it              0              Funny              0

once in a while, he would fight someone, kill, be killed himself, and then repeat the process.It was all so extreme, and I didnt understand any of it, but...The man continued to burn throughout the entire manga.And before I knew it...I found myself with a clenched fist.Reviewer’s Rating: 9What did you think of this review?Nice              0              Love it              0              Funny

  Plainly put, this is garbage.This is the type of story writing and story telling that is killing the writing industry.It's a story disguised as a complex one, but at the core, it is simple beyond belief.The twists and turns of the plot are simply there to briefly trick you even though you've already known the outcome of a certain event.All its "complexity" just seems like the author getting new ideas and then cramming that idea into the story, realizing it doesn't end in a favorable outcome, and then finding ridiculous ways to explain why the favorable outcome was achieved.This is just over-hyped beyond belief....--An update--I never imagined my review would get top.I've had countless angry fans raid my inbox and comments.Most want to just berate me, but some do want more information.For those few people, I will add some more:The interaction and dialogue between characters seems off.To me, they do not communicate like a normal person.I know they are meant to be odd people, but the writing made it difficult to understand or even become interested in what they had to say.The best way I could describe it is if aliens came to Earth and only studied humans via anime.And then they tried to write a story based around two awkward anime characters, that's what this felt like.Some people have pointed out that it is due to bad translation.My first language is Japanese, I read all Japanese literature untranslated.As stated before, the "complexity" is just a mess.The many "rules" of the world are not defined, but this seems to be very intentional, but not to provide "mystery" or "twists".It seems as though the author made it so they can add or modify rules for their needs.The "twists" only seek to surprise us without adding any value to the plot.Situations in the novel change, drastically at times, for no apparent reason but only to meet the author's objective.This is a classic blunder by bad writers.They have a beginning and an end, but they don't know how to write the middle to tie the two."the man fell off the cliff...but didn't die because a dragon saved him!and the dragon never comes back into the story"Hope this helps

no Kimyou na Bouken Part 7: Steel Ball Run(Manga)add        (All reviews)      Apr 25, 2015RealhumanbeanRecommended                 Serving as a soft reset for Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, Steel Ball Run takes the story in original and daring directions.But does it work?Oh who am I kidding?I'm going to be straight up.I consider Steel Ball Run to be one of the greatest written works I've ever read.STORY: 9/10 I will admit Steel Ball Run has a very, very slow start.In fact, Stands aren't even introduced until like 20 chapters in.That's another thing: Steel Ball Run is seinen instead of shounen.That means each chapter ranges from 35 to 60 pages long in comparison to the 20 page long                  ...chapters of the Jojo Parts before.This may seem daunting at first, but once you get invested in Steel Ball Run it feels like the story was too short, despite being the longest Jojo Part to date.Steel Ball Run also changes the Jojo formula in its fights.Stands are no longer humanoid for the most part, and they function more as superpowers than spirits who fight for you.Each fight is engaging and unique, dealing with psychological warfare more than throwing blind punches.This makes the fights in Steel Ball Run among the best in the series.Steel Ball Run is also magnificently written with very great story arcs throughout.However, there is a controversial near the very end direction which I won't spoil that will surely throw some people off and make them consider it unnecessary.Eh, I didn't mind it too much, though it does undermine what made a previous Part so good to a degree.Despite that, it still contains one of the greatest and most emotional endings I've ever read.ART: 10/10  Part 4 may have been the pinnacle of Araki's style, but Steel Ball Run is his pinnacle in his talent.Truly perfect art in all fields.The detail is much more in depth than previous Parts and character designs are on point.CHARACTERS: 10/10 Steel Ball Run, though its primary cast is a fraction of other Parts, contains some of the best characters in Jojo, and in my opinion some of the best characters of all time.Gyro Zeppeli qualifies for the latter.He's hilarious but he also has a tragic backstory that offers him plenty of motivation while keeping him in mystery.Diego Brando is an interesting spin on Dio Brando from The Phantom Blood and his Stand Scary Monsters is awesome.Lucy and Steven Steel are a great duo.Steven is barely in the story but he's a well written and unique supporting character and while Lucy doesn't really come into play until the finale she is still compelling.Wekapipo is one of the best side protagonists and works well as a foil to Gyro.Steel Ball Run also contains my favorite side villain, Ringo Roadaggin, and though his time spent in the story is brief it is arguably he pinnacle of Jojo.As for the Jojo and main villain, they're simply the best.Johnny Joestar is a tragic lightning rod of Shakespearean proportions.It's not only impossible to not root for him, it is immoral.He has one of the greatest and most significant character arcs I've ever experienced, and his Stand Tusk is awesome to boot.He is my favorite Jojo bar none, despite being one of the most depraved ones.Johnny is immoral and sinful and honestly can be considered the villain of Steel Ball Run, but he is still a compelling force of nature.The villain, President Funny Valentine, in contrast, can be considered the hero to an extent, and is one of the most sympathetic villains to grace manga.In fact, it's no secret Funny Valentine is my favorite antagonist ever.He's like a better version of Ozymandias from Watchmen who takes pride in his actions rather than cry in secret.A true patriot, Funny Valentine will stop at nothing to make America great again.As said by the man himself, his "heart and actions are utterly unclouded.They are those of JUSTICE.".His Stand, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (D4C), has one of the most insane and unique powers of any Stand and makes for a more than satisfying final fight.ENJOYMENT: 10/10 Steel Ball Run blew me away in every way.It is a literal epic, a poetic work of great magnitude following flawed heroes on a large scale journey that tests their spiritual and emotional strength as well as their physical.It is compelling and powerful and the fights are pretty damn great.Absolutely mind blowing and awe inspiring yet will leave you in an emotional wreck, despite the story still being filled with trademark Araki humor (Thanks mostly to Gyro and his obsession with making up gags).Johnny and Gyro are a perfect tag team; their relationship is strong and real and their chemistry is on point.They are part of what makes the story so damn compelling.OVERALL: 9.75/10 Steel Ball Run is one of the most intense and pleasing emotional rollorcoasters I've ever experienced.It contains some of my favorite characters in fiction history and is a fantastic new take on the Jojo universe that, dare I say, is utterly superior to all that's come before it.Featuring my favorite fights, my favorite Jojo, my favorite villain, my favorite story, and one of the most emotional endings I've read, it's no secret that I consider Steel Ball Run to be the greatest Jojo Part, and one of the greatest manga ever created, period.Reviewer’s Rating: 10What did you think of this review?Nice

gets plenty of praise, so I will mostly focus on criticism for this review, despite the fact that I do have plenty of positive things to say about Berserk.I want to make a review that will be legitimately helpful to people, rather than simply echoing the beliefs of every other reviewer on here.Look at the myriad "10" reviews for raving about how amazing it is, there is plenty of that already.This series does not get nearly enough proper criticism.Please read the whole thing before marking the review "helpful" or "not helpful."Because if you don't                  ...finish it then you don't really know, do you?The first flaw that is quickly apparent is in the first three volumes, or is simply the first three volumes in their entirety.They are a tad cliché and they follow our beloved lone wolf anti-hero and his elf buddy (comic relief sidekick who also heals out of convenience to the plot) on a couple adventures.The villains are cliché, everything is kind of cliché, the art is nothing special (yet), and it seems sort of generic.Not the best exposition to any series.This would have been best moved into chronological order.The true glaring issue here is that, after this, there is a lengthy flashback/reverse-time-skip that lasts around 11 volumes and is called the "Golden Age" arc.This arc will now be called the "GA" arc because typing on my iPhone is inconvenient.It is easily and widely acknowledged as the best part of the series, to the point where people dub berserk the greatest manga of all time simply because of this one arc, but it is still seriously held back by the first three volumes.The conclusion of the astounding GA arc is one of the most intense and emotionally impactful scenes in manga and it would have been, additionally, one of the most unexpected, but we already knew it would happen, due to the first three volumes, which greatly lessened the impact.It was a great scene, but it could have been even better and had an even greater effect on me as a reader.I would not have seen it coming if not for the first three volumes, despite some masterful foreshadowing within the GA arc itself.There was a marked lack of foresight shown in the first three volumes.It seems like Miura was trying to show how everything built up to the situation in the first three volumes, but by the time I finished the GA arc, I really didn't care about the first three volumes anymore.I could nitpick some elements of the GA arc, but it's so superior to the rest of the series that I won't even bother.The art slowly became some of the best and most detailed art in manga, but it was also often used as a crutch after the GA arc.The misty valley arc is the earliest example of this.The image of the “elves” slaughtering each other and “playing human” was one of the most brutal in the series, and it may fit in thematically, but the arc lacks overall significance and character development, especially considering its length.It would have established Guts's personality after the GA arc and how he had changed, but we already knew from the first three volumes.It was also the perfect opportunity to turn Puck into something more than a pointless comic relief character that we've seen a million times before, but that potential was quickly squandered as well, and Puck's character never really develops beyond a comic relieving plot device.Guts's showdown with the evil apostle fairy chick foreshadowed a descent into fights that are shounenesque in both verbosity and length, a serious depart from the gritty fantasy realism that the series is so often praised for.The realism further deteriorated as it went on, proportionally to the increase of clear shounen elements.Guts gathered a crew à la one piece, an inexplicable depart from his character, including an uninteresting masochist, a loli witch, and a motherfucking veritable shounen protagonist.The loli witch was one of the worst things to happen to the series.The thief kid/shounen protagonist was another one of the worst.I have no idea what Miura was thinking there.The masochist chick was actually quite an interesting character before she fell in love with Guts and started rolling with his crew.She was a powerful reflection of the pervading theme of masochism that usually manifests itself in the oft depicted self-destructive nature of humanity.Now she's the epitome of cliché.She shows some promise of recovery, but at the pace the plot is moving that will likely be in the distant future.The women are all in love with Guts by the way.No shounen is complete without a harem of women who exist to make the protagonist look cooler.The Skull Knight was another promising character, but it's been a while since we've seen him, he appears infrequently anyway, and having next to nothing known about him, after all this time, is simply bad writing.There has been some fairly obvious clues regarding his identity and origin, but there has been no true follow up on that, and we still know very little about him as a character.He's only existed to make a couple of convenient actions and philosophize about Guts's fate.Therefore, he too, has been reduced to more of a plot device than an actual character.There is also a possible major contradiction in his backstory, but I can't get into it without spoilers and I suppose it could still be explained somewhere down the road.Magic was introduced along with the witch and the crew gained shounenesque (I'm using this word a lot) power ups and thus realism went entirely out the window.Guts got a power-up that was reminiscent of Sasuke's curse mark early in the Naruto series.The theme of camaraderie is more omnipresent and becomes more about the “power of friendship,” harem elements develop, the ruthlessness is reduced, there is a moe loli witch, there is now campy abilities and gimmicks, there is shitty power-ups, there is in-battle commentary by secondary characters, battles are often increasingly drawn out, yesterday's enemies are today's friends, characters announce special moves when they are preformed, the general purpose becomes a noble fight against the very idea of evil, there is a general saturation of overused clichés and tropes, and there was even a slapstick comedy fanservice shower scene.Yup, berserk is undeniably in an increasingly noticeable downward spiral into battle shounen territory.Many fans deny this, but they are, well, in denial.This is sort of funny seeing as so many Berserk fans are pseudo-elitists who hate on popular battle shounens.It may be more explicit than a typical shounen series, but that superficial aspect of it does not grant it any sort of inherent maturity.Now, the mangaka clearly has no idea of what to do with the story.It's been ongoing for over twenty years and the story isn't close to being done; it is moving at a snail's pace, both on the rate at which it's released and the actual speed of plot development.It has been a half a year since the last chapter came out.Recently there was an arc where the motley crew nobly fights off a sea god/kraken thingy and mermaids are somehow involved.And they actually teamed up with comic relief pirates.My one piece comparisons are getting more accurate.Now, exactly what was the point of this arc?No one knows, but it sure as fuck isn't the fucking elf island that they've been trying to get to for over 10 fucking volumes.Fuck...He's clearly stalling because he's out of ideas.The dude does have serious myopia and a strange method of storytelling.He once decided that a published chapter of Berserk didn’t count because it gave too much information and insisted that it never be printed again.Seriously.If you’re putting that little thought into what you publish and how it will affect future chapters, that’s a problem.These 18 pages introduced a huge concept (although they didn’t go into great depth about it) that has yet to be seen again, even over 200 chapters later.Ummm, maybe you should have just kept the chapter after all?Despite my criticisms, the GA arc is a tragedy of epic proportions and it is a must read for any manga fan.There is a reason that this is the highest ranked manga on MAL.It has extraordinarily wide appeal and some very good qualities, despite it often falling into the "sex and violence=depth" trap.Make no mistake, I may compare it to shounens, but it is still far superior to shit like Naruto; you won't hear the word nakama being tossed around, although similar themes of companionship are increasingly echoed in a more subtle manner, and, unlike the worthlessly lazy Tite Kubo, Kentaro Miura puts an incredible amount of effort in his artwork.Although he made many mistakes in the plot, his artwork is indisputably among the best in later volumes.I've seen maybe one or two mangaka that come close or are on the same level.Guts is a powerful and tragic character and Griffith and Casca are compelling, until something happens to Casca, which kills her value as a character, and reduces her to a plot device for the majority of the series.One of the early themes of Berserk was how every man had his own dreams and motivations and, at least during the GA arc, it showed.All of the characters were detailed and had their own emotions.You could make an argument that, at that point, not a single character was a one dimensional plot device.Later on we get Guts's aforementioned posse, plus at least three or four comic relief characters with no depth to speak of, or higher purpose to serve in the storyline.I'd say that Guts and Femto are the only true quality characters, as it stands right now..The fact that I still have sympathy for Femto after all that he did, really drives in what a great and multi-faceted character he is, his character is full of symbolism, and his rivalry with Guts is incredible.The antagonists have become less convincing over time.Despite interesting theories about and the philosophical nature of Void, and despite the fact that they all have awesome character designs, only one of the God Hand members is truly developed and compelling.One of them has only really existed for fanservice.Did I mention that berserk is actually pretty big on fanservice?Shit, Conrad isn't even good for fanservice, the Majin Buddha lookin fat fuck.Conrad's "personality" section in the Berserk Wikia is blank for a reason.He just kinda floats there while everybody else does all the hard work.And don't even get me started on Ubik.There's a reason his Berserk Wikia page doesn't even have a personality section.And at least Conrad made that big rock hand thing during the eclipse, this tentacle-ass motherfucker does absolutely nothing at all.What does Ubik even bring to the table?They oughta fire him or something..... Femto is an incredible and complex character that is the perfect foil to Guts while paralleling him in many ways.I don't expect all of the God Hand to be that, but at least give us something.I rate highly on conclusions as well as expositions, and from the looks of it, this series will have a very bad conclusion, or not have one at all.The climaxes of the series were often vastly epic, although the arguable biggest climax was pretty early on and the story never reached that height again in terms of intensity or quality, but the exposition was sub-par to say the least, and we'll have to see about the conclusion, but I'm not too hopeful.The GA arc is kind of rendered pointless if the overall series fails to deliver on its promise and delivers a lackluster conclusion.That's just speculation though.He may pull it off yet.But, at the pace he’s going, I seriously doubt it.Art: 9.5/10 (it wasn't as incredible in early volumes and there were some minor mistakes and inconsistencies throughout, so minus .5)Characters: GA arc 10/10, post GA 5.5/10Story: GA 10/10, otherwise 6/10Enjoyment: 9/10 Easily, it's only recently that my enjoyment of it has significantly waned, but enjoyment is the least important category by far and I don't usually count it, except when I'm deciding whether to round up or down.Overall: 7/10Actually a very good rating, considering this was a mostly critical review.I just felt like the series wasn't getting properly called out on its flaws, although I like it.The fact is that it's far from perfect and I believe my "7" rating is a somewhat generous one, inflated due to nostalgia and other similar biases.In addition, the GA arc is simply too amazing for me to give the series anything below "good."That arc will stay with me forever and I've read it around 7 times.Too bad the mindless fanboys will not consider any of this and will simply click "not helpful" without reading the review, despite the fact that "7" is a positive score.On the other hand, haters may deem "7" to be too high a score and they will be butthurt as well.Well, I said what I had to say and I stand by it.Reviewer’s Rating: 7What did you think of this review?Nice              0              Love it              0              Funny              0              Confusing              0              Informative              0              Well-written              0              Creative              0More reviews by Polyphemus (34)            Show allRead moreShow lessOpen              Report One Piece(Manga)add        (All reviews)      Mar 6, 2008VK11RecommendedPreliminary                                                      (534/?chp)                                                   The key of success for many shounen anime is usually how well the anime is adapted from the manga.So when people are disappointed with the results of the anime, they usually resort to simply just reading the manga and follow the storyline through that.One Piece is a result of one of the few rare cases out there where the anime adaptation has followed the manga almost tooth and nail, with pretty much nothing lost within the translation between the two.With the anime receiving high review results here on MAL, I decided to take a closer look at the manga,                  ...and as far as shounen stories go, see if One Piece lives up to the accepted truth that the manga is better than the anime.This is not going to be your standard review.Because of the popularity of One Piece, where most fans know what it is already about, I will delve into more of the concepts, ideals and symbolism that sets apart One Piece from its counterparts.We begin with the story.At this point in the game, I'm sure everyone who's reading this review or simply have been a fan of anime, know the general gist of what the plot is behind One Piece.If you don't, I will be the first one to say that you're probably living under a rock.Either that, or you're living at the north or south pole, isolated away from the anime civilization itself.Without straying too much off topic here, One Piece is a story about Monkey D. Luffy and his ragtag group of pirates, all trying to accomplish their respective goals, enduring hardships, heartaches, laughs, sadness, happiness and everything in between.As you read from chapter one and all the way through the latest arcs, you'll be unveiled to so many creative story developments, places, people and idea.That is what makes One Piece so fun, the creativity of it all.Eiichiro Oda (the manga-ka) has created such an amazing and unique world that it is something that you will have a hard time finding in other anime, if at all.Though the story seems simple at heart, as you read deeper into One Piece, you'll be unveiled to secret plots and hidden agendas that will have you shaking your legs in anticipation to see how everything will mesh together in the end.The big difference in regards with the story of One Piece as compared to other shounen is the fact that the story actually gets better as the series progresses longer, breaking the age-old cliche that shounen titles usually carry, where the story will start to suffer the longer the series goes on.Oda has managed to introduce a plethora of different sub-plots that he flawlessly weaves together with the overarching aim of the story about friendship, the sense of adventure and the joys and heartaches that come with the pursuit of your dream.It takes awhile for the sub-plots to start developing, as Oda will subtlety leave hints and clues early on in his story that will blow you out of the water when you encounter them much later.This clearly shows that Oda knows exactly where he wants to go with the story.One Piece has fallen under heavy scrutiny from all kinds of anime fans because of the different art style that Oda utilizes in his epic story.Honestly, it is a hit or miss.I have found that you will either love it or hate it and as a result, will either love One Piece or hate the anime.As unfortunate as that sounds, its the simple truth I have discovered about the art style.However, I do urge you to give it a shot because if there is anything that grows on you, it is this art style.As you read more and more and get used to seeing the art drawn "One Piece style," you'll - hopefully - grow to accept and love the style.The art style starts off not so great, but again, as the story develops, you can easily see how Oda and his assistants were able to refine the art to something that works, and looks, beautifully.Going into other aspects of the drawings, everything is relatively easy to follow, especially the epic fights as compared to other shounen manga out there.It's a nice change of pace where you can actually understand what's going on.Backgrounds are given a nice amount of detail and character designs are original and fresh, with different arcs having characters with different clothes and such.Arguably, the biggest strength of One Piece, that brings it over the top, is the characters and their developing relationships with one another.Luffy's crew has the most original and different mannerism characters you'll ever see in shounen anime and its a wonder how they all get along in the first place (then again, they all don't get along).Though Luffy is your typical shounen hero who is not bright, a black hole for a stomach (though in One Piece, his huge appetite has an actual reason behind it) and courageous when needed, what sets Luffy apart from other shounen heros is his hilarious personality.His comic relief is so funny that you'll be laughing out loud at some of the things he does.The same can be said about the other crew members, and really, every major character in One Piece itself.All characters have a defining trait or quality that you'll either love to pieces or hate with a passion.Watching as they interact with one another and often times their completely opposite personalities clashing with one another, it only provides great room for developing relationships between the many characters in One Piece.And it is these great developments between characters in One Piece that leads to the biggest theme the encompasses One Piece - friendship...or as stated a seemingly infinite number of times - nakama.However, the word nakama, though commonly referred to as friend, comrade and such, has a deep-rooted meaning that cannot be described in words.More than friends, bonds running deeper than blood can tie people together, you get the picture.In order to understand the meaning, you really need to immerse yourself into One Piece and until you hear/read Luffy (who, by the way, is the only character who can say I will protect my nakama and look cool in doing so) say exactly that.When you come right down to it, what sets apart One Piece from other long-running shounen is the plethora of genres that not only exist in One Piece, but really come alive and apparent.To begin with, an essential part of One Piece is it's comedy.While other shounen try to input comedy as much as possible, usually it doesn't live up to expectations or is very scarce within the story.One Piece is filled with comedy that, as I stated up above, will make you laugh out loud.And this is only accentuated by the great drawings of Oda himself.However, as much as the humor is a big part of One Piece, there are also many stunning events that will draw a lot of passion out of you, whether it be a feeling of sadness, happiness, anger or simply have you staring in the page at awe, Again, I cannot stress this enough that One Piece is a story that has every single plot element you can wish for.Well, with the exception of a true romance, but because of the nature of the characters, it's kind of hard to see a budding romance evolve.And as a result, Oda wisely has left it out to date.You'll see a everything from mystery, suspense, drama, a little dash of horror, etc.Overall, for roughly every two or three die-hard fans of One Piece, you'll probably find one person who can't stand the series.Which pretty much goes to show you that regardless of what rumors you may hear about how amazing or how ridiculous One Piece is, it is something you must experience for yourself and give it a fair chance.I will play devil's advocate and say that One Piece is slow to start off with, where the story really doesn't pick up until the Arlong Arc.Until Luffy recruits the first four or five crew members, then the hilarious character interactions start coming alive.And coincidentally, that is when the plot starts to hit its stride, with Oda starting to leave his hints of what's to come later.It does take some patience.If anything, I urge you to read up to there and a little further so you can get a sense of what's to come.If you still can't understand why its so epic, its safe to say you may drop the series.However, when you compare One Piece to other shounen anime of its kind, and really, all anime and manga to date, there is no other story out there as epic, as emotional, as developing, as truly amazing as what Oda is telling in One Piece.Reviewer’s Rating: 10What did you think of this review?Nice              0              Love it              0              Funny              0              Confusing

                      One Piece is the most overrated piece of fiction I’ve ever read.It’s mostly about a roaming crew of do-gooder clichés that travel the high seas.Each character has a dream (which they will never achieve because this cash cow will never end) and of course a tragic backstory to go with it.One Piece is somehow popular while having the worst character designs in anime, includes countless scenes of characters sobbing like crybabies, and will drag on to the point no one will care anymore.Honestly, if you want a shonen that doesn’t insult your intelligence and make you feel like you’re reading something                  ...written by a smarter than average 10 year old, then don’t pick this up.Story: While there are some decent dramatic moments here and there, they’re almost always forced as much as possible and accompanied by over the top water faucet tears or something else as corny that makes you want to punch a hole in the wall.Not only that, but it’s the same thing each time.Straw Hat crew arrives at an island, the people are friendly but something is wrong.We then meet the villain who is doing stereotypical villain things.Luffy hotheadedly decides he is gonna save the day and starts yelling.Luffy takes on the boss and his crew mates take on the underlings.They are stronger than expected, but through the power of friendship and encouragement from the people of the island they will themselves to victory with their new attacks they just invented.With everything said and done, celebration is had, and the Straw Hats leave as the citizens thank them and promise to always remember their kindness.Repeat for hundreds of chapters.If that sounds boring to you, then good, it’s very lame.Let me add that people harp on about how great the world building is, but the world is just a nonsensical LSD theme park with clouds you can stand on and other magical stuff that never gets a good explanation and you’re just expected to eat it up and suspend your disbelief.Art: Not much needs to be said here, One Piece’s art hardly looks like anime at all, but rather doodles from a 3rd grader’s math textbook.Character: Characters are terribly developed and never really change.Usopp remains a cowardly person forever, Sanji remains a scrawny Johnny Bravo knock off that is impossible to take seriously, Luffy remains an unlikable annoying man child "who always stands up to the bad guy with no fear" (that's all his character amounts to though, lol and there is no originality), Zoro is your cookie cutter “badass” character, etc the characters are bad, have no actual depth, and are uninteresting.Enjoyment: Clearly some people enjoy this, but I certainly didn’t.I read it in bursts, people kept trying to drill into my head how great it was so I kept going back, forced myself to read another 200 or so chapters, then got sick and put it back down.Now I write this review to tell you how lousy I think this comic is.Overall: One Piece is poor.Yes, Naruto, Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Death Note, and many others are great shonen stories that I encourage people to read and enjoy.Reviewer’s Rating: 1What did you think of this review?Nice

2020Cindy-UchihaMixed Feelings                 While rating this I've pulled out my shounen wow-those-fights-are-so-cool heart in order to review this as fair as possible for the mangaka.Still couldn't give this a high mark.Story:The story and worldbuilding are so incredibly weak.The mangaka pushes you straight into action and from that point on you're in a rollercoaster that's only going hard downwards with no rest, meaning that there's no time to rest and therefore no time to enjoy the hype (no light without darkness yknow).Towards the end, the story underwent an acceleration.The story that didn't even have anything to offer, underwent a goddamn acceleration.I couldn't even believe                  ...the plot twist.I thought that there must've been something behind it, but guess, what, that was it.I wouldn't have know that I finished the manga today if I didn't add it on MAL.Thinking about it now, maybe the manga was already going at the speed of light from ch 1.At a certain point, the only bait was the question of who the protagonist is going to bang.Art:The fights aren't even that cool either.They're just normal.Sure, if this is your first action-gore and you discovered your action-gore kink with it, then I understand.But there are loads of other manga's out there with much better and more original fights and gore.Chainsaw man has nothing special to offer.The only things worthy of mentioning are the details and the originality to make monsters out of objects (though personally, that was really childish, but that's really subjective).Characters:The simpleness of the protagonist in the beginning should be praised.It fits perfectly in a feel-good/cool-fight shounen.But then it got too simple.Until the end, we had almost no insight into the protagonist's past.Not that that should be necessary, but there was also no character development.Nobody had character development.Reviewer’s Rating: 5What did you think of this

example I have ever found of something which you should not judge by its literal cover.Looking at the picture on MAL, I initially thought the story was about some young girl and a weird penguin/bird thing and only really added it to my list because it’s ranked #15 on this site.It was not until after I read another manga by the author, Asano Inio, called Nijigahara Holograph, and looked more into what this manga was actually about, that I finally decided to read it.And I could not have been more wrong in my initial assumption.But enough                  ...about that intro which was just to help dispel any similar thoughts people looking at this manga might have, I’ll get into the real review now.So many manga (and actually many things in about every single story-telling medium that humans have ever had) often try to create likeable characters, a plot that while it may have many sad parts manages to rebound and become upbeat at some points, and/or very unrealistic characters or settings.Oyasumi Punpun is basically the opposite of all of that.Despite having comedy in the beginning (which is 99% black humor anyway), Oyasumi Punpun is possibly one of the most depressing and realistic things I have ever come across.It is the “coming of age” story of a boy named Punyama (later Onodera) Punpun, and follows him all the way from elementary school until around his early 20’s.What makes this manga so special is the heavy psychological aspects surrounding Punpun and everyone else throughout the story.One of the main psychological aspects of the story has to do with Punpun’s character design.He, as well as his family, start off looking like some kind of 2 dimensional birds with long legs.His design changes a lot later on to reflect how he is feeling on the inside, but the important thing to remember is that he looks just like a normal human being to everyone else in the manga and that he does not actually look like a “bird-thing” to them.The story of Oyasumi Punpun begins with Punpun in elementary school.The girl he had a crush on has just transferred out of his school, but shortly afterward a new girl named Tanaka Aiko transfers into his school.It’s love at first sight for Punpun.He starts to slowly grow closer to Aiko while at the same time hanging out with friends and just being a normal boy who is entering puberty.Among his group of friends (I’ll just name the ones who are important at some point later on because I don’t really remember the others) there are Shuntarou Harumi, a nice boy who wears glasses; Seki Masumi, a delinquent boy with family problems; Shimizu Koh, a strange boy who can see the “god of poop” and who has been friends with Seki since childhood.The group of about 6 boys in total is just your average group of male friends who enjoy finding porn magazines, doing tests of courage, and spending their time just trying to enjoy themselves.I won’t talk any more about the story because going any farther in any way would spoil things.There’s just so many things that Asano Inio goes into amazing detail about in this dark and depressing story that explaining any more would ruin some part of it.The story covers a lot of time as I already mentioned and Punpun’s elementary school life is only a small, yet very crucial part of the entire plot.As for the art, it’s simply amazing.The idea of making Punpun look different to the reader than to everyone else is a great way to show his true emotions in a way that showing him as he really looks could not.As for the other character designs, they are all very well drawn especially Punpun’s family who also resemble 2D birds with long legs.The people who look like normal humans are usually drawn normally, but they can look ugly at times or beautiful at times when the author wants to make them look similar to how they are feeling.Especially with Shimizu (who is usually seen with a runny nose) he can actually look very intelligent at times despite normally seeming to be the exact opposite.Also, this manga is very mature and occasionally contains nudity, but it is never used as fanservice and is only used to increase the darkness of situations and to expand on the imperfections of the characters.The backgrounds are even better than the character designs.The varying settings that take place in different locations throughout the manga never slack in a single frame and stay consistently good throughout the story.The art right from the beginning is great which is something I can’t say about all long manga that are published over many years.One feature of the art which Asano Inio often uses is that he will keep the same background for several panels but the images in the foreground (people, objects, etc.)will change.While I normally don’t like repetitive panels (or shots in anime), Inio uses this to increase the psychological aspects as well as the importance of these scenes.He makes the reader focus on what is happening and draws you in in a way where you suddenly realize five chapters later that you are not actually in Punpun’s world but are sitting in the real world.And this repeats many times (at least it did for me) over the course of the manga.The art is so realistic and perfectly depressing that it just fits this manga so excellently in every aspect and I really can’t find anything bad to say about it.Now, the characters are possibly the most “interesting” part of the manga.As I mentioned in the very beginning, these characters are not meant to all be likable.In fact, none of them are my favorite characters despite this being one of my favorite manga.But that’s not really the point, since they are meant to be realistic.I would never consider myself or any of the people in my life one of my favorite characters if they were in an anime or manga.Real life people are much simpler than anime characters that each have bold hairstyles, unique weapons, perfect figures, etc.Real humans are not perfect, do not always have a happy ending in life, and are usually just some unnoticeable background character that you pass by once or twice during your life but leave no impact on you at all.Punpun is your average Japanese person aside from the slightly inflated psychological issues at times (but still never something that real humans have not experienced).As a child, Punpun’s uncle taught him that if he said a certain phrase, God would appear to him and help him in his time of need.Inio depicts God like a bad imaginary friend who looks like a black guy with an afro and usually gives Punpun poor advice that is kind of like a “worst case scenario to do” rather than actual help.Punpun’s journey to becoming an adult is a difficult one filled with family issues, romantic problems, sex, alcohol, depression, different jobs, etc.Oyasumi Punpun is not a happy story at all, and Punpun never even goes one chapter without being sad, questioning himself, or making a bad decision at some point (aside from the chapters that he is not in).He has many flaws and as he grows up, he starts to notice more and more of them.Punpun is the kind of person (as is often stated) who is always looking back into the past and has a hard time looking towards the future.With his kind of depressing life, looking at his past is not the most enjoyable thing to do.He has many regrets and things he wishes he could do differently if given the chance.As the story progresses, he falls farther and farther away from how he used to be as a cheerful child who dreamed of becoming a scientist in space.Many characters talk about how he is too kind and often hurts people because of his kindness and how easily he apologizes for things.Punpun is one of the only parts where I think the manga has a couple problems.While overall I actually like Punpun a lot, sometimes he just makes decisions that are a little too stupid even for him.In the later chapters, I feel like Punpun becomes mean and a little annoying at times, though this is mainly due to an overload of stress and is honestly not really anything too surprising given his difficult circumstances.It’s not enough to hurt the manga overall, but I thought I should mention it.Inio acknowledges that Punpun has changed a lot as well by drawing him in an extremely different way than he was ever depicted before.Punpun's main source of drama comes from remembering his middle school crush Aiko.Punpun seems to always be going back and thinking about Aiko, and much of the parts that I dislike a little about him involve her.Seki and Shimizu follow kind of a side story for most of the manga.After middle school, they never really see Punpun at all, yet they are still very important characters in the story.They have been friends since preschool and Seki has always had to take care of Shimizu.Shimizu is just a strange boy who can see the “god of poop” in a way that is kind of similar to how Punpun can see God (minus the horrible advice that Punpun gets).As they grow up, they try to stick together but many problems threaten to tear their friendship apart.Seki has always been a delinquent and keeps getting into more and more trouble.Shimizu has always been gullible and somewhat childish but he tries to become more independent.I really enjoy their story and I think they're two of the better characters in this manga.Their relationship is just like a bond between two really good childhood friends and is very believable.Throughout the manga, Punpun goes through different drama and relationships, problems and anxieties, and different designs.The characters he meets (especially the girls he is close to) change each time.The story often focuses on characters other than Punpun in order to piece together the entire story.I won’t talk about all them as it would take too long, but if you want to see all of the characters who are very important at some point, just go to the character list.This is now one of my favorite manga and only the second that I have given a 10/10 rating to.It’s a masterpiece that shows how real life works and how all of the problems in real life are not easily solvable like they are in many stories.It may be one of the most depressing manga out there, but if you can handle that kind of story as well as many mature themes and some nudity, then I highly recommend Oyasumi Punpun.It’s not something you should go into lightly, but if you enjoy these kind of life-changing stories, then this is something you should not miss.Reviewer’s Rating: 10What did you think of this

Nov 5, 2009VelkanRecommended                 Onani Master Kurosawa is something entirely different than what you see at first glance.If you are expecting something erotic or funny, you are looking in the wrong place.Those that can get past the synopsis and exposition will be rewarded, as when you reach the real bulk of the story you will realize just what it has to offer.It is no secret that this manga deals with mature themes.The problem lies within the fact that it paints the wrong picture for potential readers.The focus is not to be sexually explicit.Rather, it is presented to us in a way that is very                  ...conservative.It shows nothing more than what is necessary to get the point across.In the big picture, this is not a perverted manga in any sense.It is sweet, heartbreaking, and inspiring.The story quickly lays the foundation for a school-life setting with a character who has a secret "daily routine".Our main protagonist, Kurosawa, is a guy who cares nothing for interaction with others.He has no friends and has never fallen in love.He converses the minimal amount to simply maintain relations.What he doesn't know is that his seemingly harmless ritual is about to become something that weighs more heavily on him than he could imagine.This story shows us just what can happen when you get in over your head, the consequences of your actions, realizing what you want in life, and much more.Once the plot picks up, you will find yourself always wanting to know what will happen next.The contents are never predictable, and every bit of it is believable.It controls your emotions like a puppet on strings.It will make you feel.The art is sketched, fitting in perfectly with the mood of the manga.It does a great job of showing character's expressions, using many close-ups and careful shading.Much of the emphasis is on the characters, so the backgrounds are usually simple or non-existent.Overall it is very clean and should bear no complaints.Characterization is simply amazing.No matter how perverted Kurosawa is portrayed, the fact still remains that he is an incredibly well-rounded, believable, and likable character.The manga has the ability to create Kurosawa as if he were a character born from your own thoughts.While I am not referring to perverted thoughts, his reactions to a given situation are so real that you often think and feel the same way.I felt his anger when he was betrayed, I felt his hopelessness during his hard times, and I felt his happiness when something warmed his heart.Over the course of the plot, Kurosawa changes slowly into an entirely different person.He begins as an introverted kid who violates people in his thoughts with masturbation, yet in the end he becomes undeniably mature.He battles with self-realization, learns of consequences, finds the good in people, and comes to understand what he wants in life.Without a doubt, he is a character that will fill you with emotion.If any manga is capable of changing my view on a character, it is this one.It does not just tell you how someone feels, it places you in the shoes of a person and allows you to understand it from their point of view.Even if you think a character will play a generally small part, they always end up coming back and influencing Kurosawa in some way.We are allowed to see every character's true thoughts, whether it be directly shown to us or revealed through Kurosawa's deductions.However, you will never feel as though you can predict a character's actions.While they surprise you, every bit of it is believable.This is what depth is all about.Overall, Onani Master Kurosawa is definitely something you will appreciate reading to the end.It brings us a small introduction and builds off of itself, constantly raising the bar.It gives us a surprisingly large impact that can be found in few other places.To sum it up, it is simply a work of art.Reviewer’s Rating: 10What did you think of this

8, 2021PraiseTheSun123Not Recommended                 Attack of Titan is the prime example of how a story –no matter how good it is– can get completely and absolutely ruined in an amount of just a few chapters.That is, if you try hard enough, of course.Attack of Titan doesn’t need any introduction, ever since the anime debut in 2013 it has been one of the most popular and recognizable franchises out there, but in the end, it all boils down to one simple question: is it good?To avoid you all the trouble, the answer is simply no.I have to admit that I used to like Attack on Titan, and even                  ...for a while it was one of my favorite series, and it was for a good reason.What Hajime Isayama initially presented in Attack on Titan wasn’t a run-of-the-mill shounen, but a superb story accompanied with intricate mysteries and world-building, and while Attack on Titan has never been without its issues, those could be overlooked as the good had far outweighed the bad.But what are we seeing now, however, it’s nothing but a hollow, lame and plain uninspired imitation of what AoT used to be.What happened in Attack on Titan couldn’t be described as anything other than a huge downgrade in writing, showing signs of this as early as chapter 124, but becoming much more apparent in the last 6 chapters, culminating in what in my opinion is one of the worst end of any story I've seen so far.It’s completely nonsensical and contrived without any thematic weight, throwing away any previous build-up or foreshadowing, which it’s not only bad for itself, but also retroactively makes a lot of previous scenes as basically worthless.And not to mention how almost every character in the cast has been replaced by watered-down version of themselves, Eren being one of the worst offenders.While initially not the most developed character (though this is up to debate), Eren had one of the best character arcs in the series, just to be absolutely ruined in the exact amount of two chapters (which also are the last two), making his entire character feel like a bad joke.It's actually quite an accomplishment how much of Eren's character has been destroyed in such a short amount of time.The worst thing about this is that it doesn't only happen to Eren, but to most of the cast.Armin, for example, is another victim of bad writing.After RtS, he remains completely stagnant and even regresses as a character, as he’s shown without any of the determination or development that took place during that arc, but rather appears as a very passive character, reminiscent of earlier parts of the story.Despite that being bad writing, that wouldn’t be so bad if it wasn’t for how much the story loves his character, despite doing nothing to deserve that.He’s always shown as some kind of messiah that every character loves for no real reason and paradoxically has the most screen time (at the expense of other characters) but the least development.It's insane how much Isayama constantly tries to portray Armin as a genius and a hero just to fails so terribly at it.Then there’s Mikasa, who doesn’t even has any development or remarkable trait other than "Ereh" (and acting cool I guess), and has been like that for pretty much the entirety of the series.Thankfully though, she finally gets some development... but it’s only in the final two chapters.Which of course means that said development is completely rushed and contrived.As for the other characters, they are underdeveloped by the lack of screen time due to the sheer amount of characters in the story, so just a few characters get some significant development.Another problem is how the story (and thus its characters) loves Armin, even going as far as ruining characters that aren’t even alive to begin with for the sake of Armin.The only characters that are an exception to this are the character who dares to oppose Armin, who are pretty much next to none outside of Floch (best character) and some non-characters that no one actually bothers to remember.Anyways, I could go on with the rest of the cast, like how Levi, despite being one of the few decent character remaining, gets very few development or any moment to shine in the final arc due barely having any screen time with his character reduced to muh promise (still like I said before he’s one of better ones), or how Gabi’s characters serves no thematic purpose other than to tell us the exact same thing that Reiner’s character already did just a few chapters ago.Story-wise, things aren’t much better.Due to what happens in the final arc, a lot (if not all) of the themes that the story initially presented are rendered as worthless.While the earlier parts of the story had been of mostly respectable quality, with a clear foreshadowing of future events and a solid theming, there’s no a reason to care about that now as Isayama didn’t seem to care either when he wrote this ending.It was as if after chapter 123 he was replaced with another writer as there is a clear lack of foresight in the following chapters regarding the development of the plot, especially in comparison with the earlier chapters.However, the worst part of this is the number of possible directions the series could have gone, only to ultimately pick the laziest and most predictable story development that the story could have gone.Laziness in particular is a recurrence during the final arc.The characters face no real threat despite the situation they’re in due to how protected they are by the plot, resulting in a lot of situations devoid of any logic no matter how unlikely these situations are and any tension being basically non-existent.Not much can be said about the ending without getting into some major spoilers, but it did its job of ruining whatever foundation the story previously had.It’s also worth noting how unsubtle the symbolism and the """"themes""" are during the final arc.I cannot count the number of times a character has said "I am free" or also whenever a bird appears for the gorillionth time representing freedom (such deep symbolism).Like, it’s ok, we get it, but don't shove it in my face for the tenth time in a row, it's exhausting.As for the art, it’s a mixed bag.The art initially was very mediocre and inconsistent, but with the time it got better and there was a clear improvement, it wasn’t the best of the best, but it was decent.However after a certain point the art got much more inconsistent again with a lack of effort compared to the previous improvements.Said lack of effort coincidentally happens to be reflected in the story, as the best chapters are also those with the best art, while the poorest written chapters have a mediocre art.To say that the final arc is bad would be an understatement.Other than two chapters, there is little good to see.Any share of consistency or logic is completely erased and the attempt of making something of actual substance is left as an afterthought.It makes any previous emotional investment I had with this manga purposeless and I just can't care about anything related to it now.I think it's obvious by now, but I don't recommend Attack on Titan.If you still plan on reading Attack on Titan, then I recommend to read it until 123, then drop it and make up your own ending, as it would be much more satisfying than the ending we got, otherwise don't bother.Reviewer’s Rating: 4What did you think of this review?Nice              0              Love it              0              Funny              0              Confusing              0

        "Have you ever hated someone so much, that this feeling alone would drive you to do horrific and impossible to grasp things?Have you ever hated someone so much, that your whole life was focused on finding that person and ripping him apart?Have you ever hated someone so much, that you would forget about your humanity, purge it all just to find enough power, for one, single fraction of a moment, one chance to get your revenge...What would your eyes look like in that very moment...?Insane?Terrified?Passionate?Happy?Or maybe... satisfied...Look into his eyes, and find nothing there..."When I first learned that there is                  ...something like Berserk manga, I was a bit surprised.That was some 7 years ago and little did I know about relations between anime and manga.Either way, I took my chances and downloaded several first volumes.You can imagine my surprise when I noticed that the manga is a far cry from the anime which really made my day some time ago.Having struggled through the first chapters I moved on to the next volumes.You know, the anime itself is, in all its ingenuity, only a small fraction of the whole manga... As small as several volumes with some deleted scenes and a bit redone ending at that.However, by the moment I reached 'the anime plotline' in manga (which is volume 3) I got already interested in the manga itself.I think that there's no point in summarising the plot.You can read it above, and for the sake of not spoiling anything, I think you should.You have to, however know this: Berserk manga, in terms of plotline and characters development - is by far the best manga I have ever read, the most complete one, the most multi-dimensional one, the most memorable one...Nowhere else will you be told the stories of sub characters so bluntly and yet discreet that you won't even notice.Nowhere else will you receive such a huge dose of information, and yet still be able to comprehend it effortlessly.This is something uncanny, and frankly, I doubt that anyone ever will be able to reach the level.The characters are just great.On one hand we have Gutts and Griffith, shades of black and white, fire and water.Being so different, neither can live without the other one.They're like Yin and Yang, two halves of the same coin - even in his darkest moments Griffith still finds himself as Gutts' friend, although few minutes later this friendship changes into hatred and horrific envy.Their whole story is like that, they start off as great friends who would die for each other with smiling face, but only one of them is really committed here.Characters shine even more when we consider other protagonists and antagonists.No person is left shallow and without a story to tell.Miura-sempai explains everything in a given time and briefly enough to keep you interested.Unlike in other titles where antagonists exist only to serve as a powerup training bag for the protagonist, here all demons have their motives.Even the smallest monster is explained, by which you get attached, even to such scumbags.The story itself is brutal, broody and hectic sometimes.But you never really lose the track if it.You can have two mini-arcs in one mayor arc, but you'll always remember what the team's real destination is.In this way, Miura-sempai makes it clear to you, that Gutts, although a little less passionately, follows his path and even if he was to be destroyed, he would neither falter nor go back.And the same goes for Griffith, who despite his appearance (nowhere else will you notice that appearance is deceitful so much as in Berserk) is a very strong-willed and straight-forward character.And in all this, having seen all the atrocities that happen in Midland, you never ever think of Griffith as the wrong one.He's not wrong, he's just following his dream, a dream that was clouded with Gutts appearance in his life.The art itself, is a state of art to watch and read.Detailed panels, hundreds of characters on one page during a hectic battle, highly textured monsters and what I love the most - fluid, realistic and clear fighting scenes.You don't need Kubo trolling with ink to see that Gutts has his speed even despite the weight of his sword.You don't need hundreds of straight lines to increase the dynamics of the scene - Miura-sensei  manages it all without a loss in quality.Facial expressions are something completely else.Even if you cannot follow the plot for some weird reason you can always judge whether the character is good or bad by just looking at his or her face.Those are very detailed and so rich in expressions that you never get bored.You can feel the difference between smooth and angelic appearance of Griffith and a brute, yet kind rectangular face of Gutts.The mangaka puts a lot of effort into shade and light in Berserk.By that we get a very distinctive nights, sunshines and sunsets as well as dynamic shadows (however awkward it sounds) that no anime director can mime.It's simply sensational to look at all that and even be able to read the story of it...It is clear to me, that Miura-sensei is trying to end up with a sort of masterpiece in terms of manga.And you know what?He's pretty close to achieving this.There are, however, some bad points too.The manga is not for everyone.I would strictly add parental advisory and 18+ to it.Nowhere else will you see so much nudity, sex and violence as in this manga.It's not a hentai-like nudity and sex though.Berserk shows a violent world with all its aspects, hence these parts were as relevant as any other to make the story as believable as possible.I'm glad I was able to read the manga.It's one of the best titles ever, if not the best so far.I sincerely hope though, that Miura-sensei lives up to the expectations and finishes this story in a fitting way.Judging by his up-to-date work, it's more than possible.Reviewer’s Rating: 10What did you think of

miniature literature lecture.Charles Baudelaire was a crazy French poet who was an aspiring lawyer but decided to drop it all and become the archetypal struggling artist.He borrowed money extensively and spent them on booze and whores.Of course, he burnt out and died from overdrinking alcohol but he left behind a grand literary legacy.His poetry was vulgar, decadent and entirely brilliant, inspiring a movement called the Symbolist movement.But rather than focus on Baudelaire, let’s focus on another poet called Rimbaud (Takao also reads him).Rimbaud became and avid fan of Baudelaire.He was a                  ...young teenager and felt trapped in his parent’s home.He frequently ran away from home and eventually moved to Paris to join the Symbolist movement there.The most important thing he preached was the theory of the voyant.Rimbaud believed that a true poet (the voyant, or seer) could only achieve the pinnacle of his art with what he called ‘the derangement of the senses’.He believed that a poet had to achieve every kind of evil and suffering, to make his own soul into a monster.He saw Baudelaire as the first voyant in the whole of poetic history.Of course Rimbaud took the same path of decadence Baudelaire took.His poetic career only lasted 5 years, yet he wrote works that are widely read by the French public even to this day.After his 5 years in Paris, he spontaneously decided to travel to Africa and in the end became an arms dealer.He died of a sickness he caught overseas.Finally let’s go to an era that’s closer to our time, around 1940s – 1950s in America.A group of Literature students in Colombia University felt sick to their stomach about the actions of the US government and about life in general.Of course, I’m referring to the Beat Generation.Allen Ginsberg’s famous “Howl” and Jack Kerouac’s famous “On the Road” became a cult classic, leading to the rise of an entire new counterculture movement altogether.The most important thing is that the members of the Beat Generation were influenced by Rimbaud.When one reads On the Road reads up about the lives of Beat Generation writers, the main theme running among them all is spontaneity and anarchic freedom.They aimed to flout the rules and societal norms as much as possible and to lead a life of utmost chaos.After reading a couple of the reviews posted on this manga, I see the same things repeated again and again.I see people reading it as a manga about Femdom and they claim the plot is unoriginal because the “sadistic girl forcing the guy to make a contract” has been done before.On the other hand I saw the work as a completely differently thing altogether.Of course it requires a certain mindset to see this perspective.There are those people who take a look at the society they live in and genuinely hate it to the very core.They see people who live lives of unhappiness and die unfulfilled.They get the impression that everyone is socially isolated from everyone.They see people indulging in stupid pleasures like dirty jokes and momentary experiences like karaoke sessions.They think chasing after stuff like wealth and cars are just another form of escapism and self-delusion.They dream of running away to Woodstock in the 1960s and spending 3 days of freedom and drugs and rock and roll.They dream of following the footsteps of street artist Banksy and spraying paint and art all over the walls of the city.They think that people are only truly free when they are free to run around in fields, to scream, to have cathartic moment after cathartic moment, to ride On the Road without limits and without care.They don’t like the obligations they have towards society and think it’s a complete waste of time, to live such a myopic lifestyle.Of course, all this is like simple Anarchist theory.You can read more about these sorts of theories of human freedom in things like the works Situationist International and the movie My Dinner with Andre.What I see Aku no Hana as is a portrait, a representation of the burden (and it is a huge burden) and yet simultaneous beauty of leading the lifestyle of sin Baudelaire and Rimbaud once led.Nakamura isn’t just a sadistic BDSM queen; she’s a representation of that lifestyle, a symbol.Takao submits to her because the sheer thrill of their exploits is a form of exaltation.Likewise, I was drawn towards the glimpse of that lifestyle, two people doing things I could never have done and looking so unbelievably joyous in their carnage.Normally I classify works under two forms.One is a work that is a beautiful illusion, a work of fiction that is perfect in every way for escapism and sentiment, drawing out simple emotions.Things like melodramas and thrillers and comedies fall under this territory.Then there are those that have glimpses of direct, real lived experience within them, those works that can give you bits and pieces of life.These are the works that will enrapture your soul and depress you because they capture just a mere iota of a full experience that you know is currently out of your reach or force you to confront a dire reality.Things like Welcome to the NHK, Subarashii Sekai (by Inio Asano), Synecdoche New York, All About Lily Chou Chou, Fight Club (to a small extent, it’s more of a thriller).It didn’t pick up though until that first event in the classroom.The ultimate glimpse of pure anarchist delight embodied in the two dancing adolescent youths.There’s a certain mindset that you need to have before entering such works, the mindset that you are both lonely and damned, the twisted romantic view of life.Aku no Hana is a work for dreamers.The first step is to not see the main characters superficially as a mere twisted couple mimicked in many other stories but representatives of different aspects of humanity.Anarchy, conformity, angst, spite, jealousy, rebellion are all present.Seeing past all the standard critiques, it’s not a matter of clichés or characterization at all, in the end it all comes down to how much you empathize with that beautiful vision of anarchic self-destruction.This review may sound like it comes from a complete sociopath (Most likely.I had Fleurs du Mal and Rimbaud's Complete works before I even knew of the manga.Also I'm one of those hopeless dreamers who plans to live some kind of struggling artist life in the future) but this is just a single perspective that may perhaps change some people's views when engaging with this manga (I hope).Reviewer’s Rating: 10What did you think of this

manga good enough to deserve my reviewing.And after reading volume six of Shingeki no Kyojin I can safely say the wait is over.What a manga!STORY: 9/10Throughout the history of action manga there have been hordes of fantastically evil creatures ganging up on any shounen hero that dares get in their way.Whether it be demons, hollows, or demons again one thing was always certain: Even though the characters appeared scared you knew everything would be okay.A main character can't die to one random monster out of the horde.They deserve noble deaths via                  ...human vs human fights.Shingeki no Kyojin abandons decades of stereotypes and does it in remarkable fashion.Never have I been so afraid, so physically frightened by "just another mob of pure evil monsters".In Shingeki the monster of choice happens to be giants.They don't have any special powers and in fact they aren't particularly massive considering they're giants.They walk, run, and even crawl around on the ground with blank, sometimes even silly faces and do nothing but eat and mangle every human in sight.This is something the mangaka has perfected despite the fact that this is the first manga he's ever written.Every single time a giant appears on the page your heart will start racing and your palms will become sweaty.Where do they come from and why do they devour humans despite having no anatomical need for it?These are all questions the mangaka presents early and skillfully hasn't answered yet.He's also created an incredibly thought-out world with paragraphs at the end of most chapters explaining things that would bore readers if squeezed into speech bubbles.Including, but not limited to: three-dimensional flying gear, anatomy of a giant, construction of the cities three walls, battle formations, and a type of strange retractable sword.The world feels rich and thought-out and will almost certainly suck in anyone who gives Shingeki no Kyojin a chance.ART: 8/10I'm going to be perfectly honest and say that the artwork in the first two volumes is as close to shit as it gets.Actions aren't drawn very well, details aren't drawn very well, and its clear the mangaka had trouble drawing body proportions.But when volume three started it was almost like a switch was flipped and the art wasn't nearly as bad anymore.In fact, after having just finished the sixth volume, its among some of the better art I've seen in a manga.Characters are drawn very different from one another and have a crisp yet visibly sketchy feel to them.And the Giants!They slide around with their giant heads, oddly proportioned bodies, and silly facial expressions just creeping the shit out of me.The mangaka is very talented at drawing characters experiencing the scariest moment of their entire lives.What a bonus the art became in volume three, adding fear on top of fear to make one of the most chilling manga experiences even more so.CHARACTER: 9/10Everybody is somebody."What's the point of writing about a character with no personality or back story?"- Is what I imagine the mangaka asks himself before deciding to throw a new character into the mix.You'll find no blank-faced bad asses in this manga.You also won't find too many people with happy child-hoods either.Even though this is listed as a shounen it deals with very dark themes more suited for a seinen.Characters are often showed rattled and sometimes mentally scared from seeing their comrades get their heads bitten off in front of them.Either way, there is plenty of page time devoted to understanding characters and their roots.ENJOYMENT: 10/10The depth of the world is immense.The art is very good (eventually).Characters are deep.The suspense is great.The giants are TERRIFYING!It's rare to find a manga that does so many different things so well.Whenever a new volume comes out I always know I'm in for another great experience I can't get anywhere else.OVERALL: 9/10I can't give a perfect score to a manga with so few chapters so early in it's life span.But trust me; if the same amount of enjoyment I've experience in the first six volumes continues throughout the rest of the series it would be a 10 no doubt.You've gotta give this manga a shot.It's doing things that haven't really been done before, or at least not to this level.I'm setting the standard right now: You can't call yourself a fan of manga without reading Shingeki no Kyojin.Now get reading!*This review made possible by AironicallyHuman, who recommended this manga to me        Reviewer’s Rating: 9What did you think of this

OP" story where the OP MC becomes absolutely boring af.This story is a fucking masterpiece.You may be skeptical about reading it, perhaps you think it will end up trash like many generic RPG/MMO style anime/manga.I assure you that that opinion is completely wrong.The Story: 10/10Absolutely solid, it flows extremely well and is probably one of the best adaptions of a LN into a Manhwa I've ever seen.The story is filled with plots that make sense, flowing with extremely well written character development, assisted by very good character interactions.Of course, like many stories, it starts out slow.When I                  ...first started reading this story definitely pissed me off to the point that I was like "Does this even get better."Yes, yes it does.You may be annoyed with the MC and many supporting characters in the beginning but that quickly changes as the character begins to go through a change no one in this fantasy world has experienced before.He is able to level up his rank.Through that experience he drastically changes in personality and is able to experience much more action than previously before, at the bottom of the barrel.This manhwa quickly becomes exciting to read and you'll continuously be asking for more after finishing each chapter.Give it a chance and run through the chapters, I'm sure it's something all action and fantasy lovers will enjoy.Art: 10/10It's really hard to not love the art style honestly, it's beautiful and clear, well drawn, and definitely adds to the appeal of reading this.Character: 10/10I cannot get enough of how amazing each character is in their own way.This being a fantasy, theres a loott of things we can't relate to in this story, but even with that the characters are easy to understand, or relate to.The choices each characters make make complete sense based on our understanding of their personality, or their history.We aren't stuck with any characters that have overly unrealistic personalities, which makes reading this all the better.Enjoyment: 10/10I have reread all the chapters available many times and it really doesn't get old.You definitely may not see this as a Masterpiece like I do, but it is definitely a minimum of a 7/10.If you love fantasy... action... adventure.. then this is for you.Give it a chance and run through all the chapters available, I'm sure you will see the beauty in it.Overall, I give these 86 chapters currently available to us a 10/10.Reviewer’s Rating: 10What did you think of this review?Nice              0              Love it              0              Funny

ahead.I'm very sorry but that 6 up there can't be properly explained without delving deep into spoiler territory.I wish Usagi Drop had 2 separate entries, one being the start and one everything after the time-skip, starting in chapter 26.It's for one very simple reason.Usagi Drop is a prime example of how a great concept can still run off the rails badly.It's a masterclass in turning what starts as a warm, cute and fuzzy story into a catastrophic failure of a 'romantic' drama.The gist of the premise is that Daikichi (a man who couldn't more obviously be unhappy                  ...and feeling unfulfilled unless he stuck a neon sign on his face) takes a 6 year old girl, Rin, into his house for the sole reason that everyone else either hates her or straight up doesn't care for her.And it's not hard to see where this goes.A man with no experience with children now has to take care of one with the comedic hijinks that ensue.During that time, we see Daikichi and Rin grow as characters as we learn more about them, who they are and their relationship.I'll be honest, the first part of Usagi Drop is one of the best and most enjoyable things I've ever read.It's just sweet enough to tug your heart strings and make you feel great but also sincere enough to show the problems Rin and Daikichi cope with.I was ready to give this a good solid 9, maybe even a 10!Now, those of you who have seen the anime or the live-action movie might notice there's a considerable amount of material that wasn't adapted.There's a reason for that.The great part about having one person both writing and illustrating a manga is that you have synergy.Who else can better convey their thoughts, mental images and general ideas to paper than the writer themselves?The problem that comes from it is that there's no second person to openly doubt your decisions and no manga is a better example than this.I'm not sure what Yumi Unita was thinking but I hope she realizes how poorly it worked out.In chapter 26, we leap forward about 10 years.Rin is in high school and Daikichi is 40, having to deal with the appropriate issues.Already this brings up some headscratchers, such as how both of our protagonists still hang out with the exact same people they did 10 years ago with no new additions.One of two bigger problems is a shift in tone that is about as smooth and fluid as trying to walk while both your legs are asleep.Gone is the happy heartwarming slice of life, in comes an unnecessarily angsty and gloomy 'romantic' drama.Everything is a lot darker for no adequately explained reason other than some cardinal rule that anything involving teenage characters must be existential, dark or depressing.No, the biggest problem of all is that the second part builds up to an almost gutpunchingly disturbing conclusion.Part of the second part involves Rin dealing with her relationship with Daikichi getting more....complicated.Her feelings for him get out of the comfy wholesome foster parent/daughter zone and instead the considerably ickier kind.It's just as disturbing and just as well-executed as you'd expect.After an ass-pull 'but they're not really blood-related' card (on the level of SAO episode 14), Rin decides she wants to marry Daikichi and he goes along with it.Oh boy, where do we begin?Let's start with the fact that at its very core, this is still creepily close to parental incest.For all intents and purposes, these 2 had a father/daughter relationship for the last 10 years and now she's genuinely in love with him.There's also a distinct lack of consequence shown.There's one character who's ever made aware of her attraction and, no joke, she encourages Rin to go along with it.But there's another layer of disturbing that you might not pick up on the first time.Hell, you might not pick up on it until a good while later.Namely, Daikichi just rolls with it.There's no real shock, no real contemplation to speak of, he listens to her and accepts it.On the surface, it's bad writing.Underneath, it's worse.Disregarding for a moment that this is quite clearly an action of impulse, since his feelings for Rin have always been parental and it was never really hinted that it was more.What we have is a man who's more concerned with the age difference than with the fact that he raised her as his daughter.A man who has no qualms doing so.A man who, I swear I wish I was making this up, is okay with her carrying his child and raising it.A man who's just plain given up on a proper relationship.A man who by all rights shouldn't be in one because he isn't fit for one.The first part of Usagi Drop is a 9 or a 10 for me without a doubt.It's well-crafted and heartwarming to see these 2 misfits grow on each other.The second part is disgusting in every way.The change of tone, the ending, how it plays out, the implications it carries, it's nothing short of insulting your readers.If you want to read this, by all means do so.Sounding like a broken record but the first part is excellent.I highly suggest you finish chapter 24 and stop there.Because unless you're into poorly written, poorly executed semi-incest, there's just nothing for you there.Reviewer’s Rating:

  (All reviews)      May 17, 2020abystoma2Mixed Feelings                 As of the time of writing this review, I have yet to see the anime adaptation.Therefore, I’d like to offer you a point of view untainted by the ufotable hype.Note that this review might contain some spoilers, though nothing too specific.“Why should it matter if you’ve seen the anime or not?” is what you might be asking, so I’d like to address that first.I suspect that the anime adaptation had a huge impact on the manga ratings.It’s understandable to an extent, sure, I bet ufotable did a good job with the animation of action scenes which are the core of this                  ...series.Should a source material be praised because of the achievements of the adaptations though?I don’t think so.And yes, I have some numbers to support my claim about the undeserved ratings boost.In 2017, Kimetsu no Yaiba had mean score of 7.46.A week before the anime started airing, it was at 7.92.During the time period when the anime was airing the score jumped from that to 8.50 (with the current mean score being 8.55).That’s a jump up of almost 0.60 which is something that pretty much never happens organically.Sure, you could claim that the manga suddenly got better (and coincidentally in the same time frame as the anime was airing).The manga arcs published during this period was Swordsmith Village arc and a training arc after it so no, there was no sudden spike in the quality of the manga content.You can check the scores on Wayback Machine, and learn that MAL mean scores aren’t always to be trusted.Well, that’s enough of a rant, now to the manga-only experience review.Now, I’m usually quick to complain about a slow story progression and unnecessary padding.This time, I’ll have to complain about the story going way too fast.Sure, at least there are no fillers, but in exchange Kimetsu no Yaiba goes with extreme on the other side of the spectrum.Reading it feels like the author is trying to do an any% battle shounen speedrun.Everything is happening so fast in this manga.Training?Nah, here’s two chapters, two year timeskip, the protagonist is now no longer a random village hillbilly but a stronk boi who can fight demons.Good job on smashing those big rocks kid, now you’re fully prepared to fight ruthless and almost immortal creatures.Sure, training arcs tend to be not that interesting, but not only they can be made interesting, they are also important to help establishing the power system of battle shounen, which Kimetsu no Yaiba fails at completely.More on that later, now back to speedrunning.The worldbuilding is pretty much non-existent with the sole focus on rawly progressing the plot.The protagonist’s first assigned mission ever?Boom, here’s the main antagonist just strolling there, what an amazingly lucky encounter.Most of the characters feel just like a cannon fodder whose death are used for a cheap thrill.The cast dies off faster than you can create any attachment to the characters.What was probably supposed to be a dramatic character conclusion end with the impact of “Meh, another one’s dead.What was his name again?” The supporting cast dies like flies and so do the minor antagonists.It’s hardly a shock value when such thing is made a mundane occurrence.Oh yeah, also just slap some random tragic backstories for the demon in cheap attempt to not look so shallow.Few minor happenings later the final arc starts, which makes up a whole third of the whole manga.That one’s a bit special.It’s at the same time way too long and keeping the whole speedrun spirit too.The cheapness of deaths become even way cheaper, as if the author said “fuck it, I’m almost done with the manga anyway, I’ll just kill of most of the characters”.And no, they still don’t die in any satisfying (for the reader) way.The stock of nameless characters seems to be endless too, as bunch of unknown demon hunters seem get mass-murdered with almost every attack of almost every demon, yet they keep flowing in right up to the final boss encounter.How many demon hunters are there anyway?Because I fell like hundreds of them died just in the backgrounds of this arc alone.The final fight is riddled with all of the cliché bullshits such as the power of friendship, trashed characters that shouldn’t have been able to even stand up by any mean suddenly rejoining the fight again, “this isn’t even my final form you fools”, asspulls, and revivals.Yes, after all of the slaughter the author is now suddenly too much of a coward to let some of the characters die.At least go all the way in if this is what you decide to do, don’t back up at the last moment to leave us with this lukewarm entirely uninteresting and artificial-feeling ending.The epilogue chapter is an absolute joke.Well, at least I wish it was just a joke.It’s more disappointing and laughtable than the finale and epilogue of Prison School, to give you an idea about this trainwreck.I had to doublecheck if this wasn’t just some fanmade chapter, that’s how much it doesn’t fit.I have mentioned the absolute disaster of a power system previously, right?Let’s expand on that.Some sacrifices had to be made to make the speedrun possible and explanation of the powers was one of them.The last thing that makes any sense is the Total Concentration Breathing technique.Master the way you breath and do it consciously all the time to achieve a handy power-up for your stats.A bit of JoJo rip-off but sure, I’ll take it, with some suspension of disbelief it makes sense.How do we get from there to swords summoning fire, pillars of water, mist or a goddamn snakes?Fuck if I know, it’s some sort of breathing technique so you’ll have to make some shit up to make sense of it, because the manga sure isn’t going to help you with that.Tanjiro’s dad did ceremonial sword dancing, which made him a fire swordsman.Others just ripped of the fire technique to make their own breaths.How does remaking a fire technique help you summon butterflies with a sword slash?No idea.“It just works”, as they say.The characters themselves are flashy but forgettable.The flagship Nezuko admittedly excels as being adorable while still having enjoyable fighting mode side, but that’s as far as likeable characters go.Tanjiro is a ball of screams and bruteforcing given a human shape.Zenitsu is an annoying idiot with creepy tendencies who is completely useless until the plot demands him to do something.Inosuke is a ball of even more screaming and bruteforcing also given (more or less) human shape.The hashiras have basically the personalities of their character design.Honestly from some points I started to cheer for the demons instead.The protagonists are boring shounen templates with no depth.The demons at least have some motivations beyond “AAAAAAA DEMON REEEEEEEEE” and as ironic as it is, they have goals more relatable to actual humans such as just wanting to enjoy their lives.I don’t think this was intentional on author’s part though, the baddies are relatable only in comparison to the blandness of the other side.One saving grace of Kimetsu no Yaiba is the artstyle.While I wouldn’t go as far to say that the art is great, it’s certainly distinguishable and original.At least one part of this manga that attracts the readers’ attention, at least one part of this whole thing that is somehow interesting.Overall, if you’re a fan of regular battle shounen, this might be your jam.If you’re looking for anything with a substance, you would waste your time here.As pretentious as it might sound, ultimately this manga just feels… immature.Reviewer’s Rating: 5What did you think of this review?Nice              0              Love it              0              Funny              0

                                      One PieceGenre: Action, Adventure, ComedyMangaka: Eiichiro OdaLength: 514 chapters, compiled in 51 volumes [So far.This manga has been going since 1997, and it shows no signs of stopping anytime soon.]Rating: 9/10...Plot: It is the grand era of the pirates, brought upon when the great Gold D. Roger was executed 22 years ago.Pirates from all over search for his great treasure, the One Piece, hidden in the treacherous waters of the Grand Line.Our adventure begins when an 8 year old boy, Monkey D. Luffy, eats the Gum Gum Fruit, one of the many Devil Fruits &ndash; a mystical fruit that will give you supernatural powers, while robbing you of your ability to swim.He gained the ability to stretch any part of his body, as he is now, quite literally, a rubber man.His dream is to become a pirate &ndash; and he does so, 10 years later.He travels the seas, picking up crew members, fighting against evil pirates and the Shichibukai, the pirate slaves of the government, and then facing the dangers of the Grand Line in order to capture One Piece and become the king of all pirates.Analysis: It&rsquo;s a fun manga to read.When it started, it was only supposed to go on for 5 years or so &ndash; you can tell this just from the way the plot works out in the beginning.It moves along a lot faster and the fight scenes aren&rsquo;t as long as they get.The characters are more loped on than anything &ndash; they aren&rsquo;t given much of a background before joining, and there isn&rsquo;t much reason for them to do so.However, later on, the manga gets very exiting.Characters are given a lot more depth before we even know that they&rsquo;ll be joining the crew &ndash; sometimes we don&rsquo;t even know if they&rsquo;ll be joining at all.That being said, the plot of the manga is very good.Because its such an open ended dream &ndash; become king of the pirates, get one piece &ndash; there are many things that can happen in between.This is furthered by the grand line by itself &ndash; its made of up many islands, each of which has their own magnetic pull &ndash; you need a special device, called a lock post to navigate through the islands.In order to get the lock post to lock, you have to stay on each island for a specific amount of time, which can vary.Its basically an excuse to have an adventure, and it works out really well.As the manga goes on, the characters start to reveal themselves more fully.It&rsquo;s the great part about having such a long manga, that you can develop the characters a lot.It also leaves room for very long fights, most of which are really well done.They&rsquo;re fun to watch, and they&rsquo;re filled with suspense.My only problem with them is this &ndash; the protagonist, Luffy, is extraordinarily strong, all due to his self training that was done during the 10 year time skip in the first chapter.We never actually see him training for anything.He gains one technique in one of the last arcs, and he made it up kinda spur of the moment.It just seems very unlikely that he can beat some of the strongest pirates in the world without training.Finally, there is the matter of the grand line.Ignoring the sheer impossibility of the entire place, in the first part of the manga, the grand line is described as a place full of horror, fear, death, and destruction.Now, while the latter two might be true [there certainly are a lot of fights there], it doesn't seem like something very scary.The only real big deal are the pirates who you can circumvent [or fight &ndash; if you're too weak, then shame on you].Everyone makes a big deal about how scary the grand line is, but i just don't see it.Now, it is dangerous mind you &ndash; the weather patterns make it almost impossible to navigate, which makes for very scary waters to travel through.But nothing as to the extent that you are made to believe.Now, for fun, I thought that i would compare the pirates of one piece to the pirates of the real world [Yes, there is such a thing]For the first part, the pirate ship does not work as it does in the manga.Its not a matter of who is the strongest in terms of fighting ability &ndash; rather, for the most part, it was done democratically, with the crew electing who the captain is.Their targets would not be a treasure, whether by following a map [of which the idea entirely came from Treasure Island], but any passing merchant ships.Most of the time, pirates would be working for a government &ndash; these were called privateers.It was often hard to tell the difference.Fights were not decided by who was the stronger fighter.They were usually decided by who caused the biggest amount of damage to the other ships.In most cases pirates would win without a fight, due to their fearsome reputation.Next is the pirate flag.The jolly roger as we know it, and as every pirate crew has [although edited some per crew] in One Piece, wasn't prominent in a lot of ships.Often it would be a black flag for fight to the death, or red flag for fight with mercy.If it wasn't this, then it would be a national flag to try and lure prizes [ships] into a sense of false security.Pirates were not respected by most people.They were seen as barbaric brutes who only were out for themselves.This is almost the exact opposite as the manga &ndash; pirates are often seen as a hope for people, while some people hate them.The fact that there are women pirates in One Piece is astounding.Now, i don't have anything against women, but in history there have only been 5 reported cases.There might have been more, but either way it is a very rare occurrence.The women pirates in One Piece are often very important members of the crews, and in some cases lead them as the captain.Finally, the last thing that I can remember is the noted lack of ships on the sea.Even before making it to the Grand Line, the only ships that you see are either pirate ships or marine ships.Its as though boats only exist for those two purposes.Character Summary:Please note that I'm only going to do the first 5 crew members, who are the ones that appear before the Grand Line.I'm doing this in order to avoid spoilers to the maximum, because generally a character joins at the end of an arc.I'm also not covering the villians, because they are usually arc specific.Secondary characters are not being covered as well because, even this far into the manga, we don't know alot about the important ones.Strawhat Luffy, AKA Monkey D. Luffy: The hero of the story, he ate the Gomu Gomu Fruit [Gum Gum Fruit] when he was eight years old.Upon doing so, he gained the powers to stretch any part of his body to any length imaginable, however he gave up the ability to swim.He gained his nickname, Strawhat, from the straw hat that he always wears on his head.It was a gift from Red-Haired Shanks, a pirate whose crew used Luffy's town as base when he was young.It is his most treasured possession, and it becomes the symbol for his pirate crew.Luffy is a very simple boy.He has a strong moral code, and he's not too smart.However, he is a very strong fighter.He has high agility and strength, which he calls out to its fullest when used in combination with his rubber-stretching powers, which usually consists of him flinging his arm back, then letting it snap forward to hit his opponent.Its more complicated than that, but its hard to describe in words.He LOVES meat - it is the only thing that can give him enough energy to do anything.Roronoa Zoro: The second person to join Luffy's crew, and its 1st mate, he is a master swordsman.There is one difference between him and normal swordsmen however &ndash; he uses three swords [He places the third in his mouth].He made a promise to a childhood friend/rival to become the greatest swordsman in the world, and as such whenever facing a swordsman he tries his hardest never to lose, even if losing would mean walking away alive.His strength is amazing [and his teeth are most likely made out of diamonds, as well as having a mouth as dry as the desert], and before joining the crew, was feared as one of the best pirate hunters.He has a fierce rivalry with Sanji [Look Below]Zoro is a fun guy.Like Luffy, he isn't too smart, but he is very loyal.He has a terrible sense of direction, and as such usually gets lost.His skills, as mentioned, are very good.While he has not eaten any Devil Fruits, he can beat most of them.Fun fact about his attacks &ndash; most of them are named after food, and are puns.For example, one of the first 'special' attacks that he uses is Oni Giri.Oni means demon, and Giri means slash, so therefor it would mean Demon Slash.However, an Onigiri is a rice ball thats often eaten as a snack.The same is true for his swords &ndash; the kanji for them can be read multiple ways, mimicking food or something deadly.Nami: The third to join the crew, she serves as the ship's navigator.Before joining them, she introduced herself as the pirate thief, stealing treasure only from other pirates.She is really one of the only ones with any brains in her head.She acts as the ship's conscience for a good part of the series, and while to start off she didn't have any fighting skills, they grew later on as a result of her feeling weak and helpless.When Nami first shows up, you don't know whether or not she is going to join &ndash; she disappears for a while, then shows back up.She is the first one to have a real strong plot and back story appear, and as such is very memorable.Usopp: The fourth to join the crew [Gee, I wonder if I'm going in some sort of order here ...], he is the ship's sniper.He has a very big head and is full of himself, often calling himself the captain before being shot down [Get it?He's the sniper and he's being shot down ... Ha ha ha ... Punny ... :(].His father is a part of Shank's crew, and its partly for this reason that Luffy takes a liking to him.He's also a very big liar, and he loves making up stories to impress other people with his amazing, but very fake, deeds.For a lot of the series, he is a gag character, but he gains a lot of strength later on.Usopp is mostly used as comic relief.Until one of the arcs, he is not too strong, but his attacks are always fun to watch.He uses a slingshot to do his sniping with, and he has an assortment of bullets, ranging from explosions to hot pepper.Contrary to what it appears, he can analyze situations very easily.His most defining feature is his nose ... which sticks out a foot in front of his face.He is also a big coward.&ldquo;Black Legged&rdquo; Sanji: The fifth to join the crew, and the last to do so before the Grand Line, he is the chef of the ship.He was taught how to cook and fight by Red-Legged Sef, and as the name suggests, only fights with his legs.His dream is to find Deep Blue, a place where all of the oceans in the world intersect, that contains every species of fish imaginable.He loves women of all sort &ndash; except if they're ugly.But, even if they are, he will never hit a woman.The only times that he gets angry is when food/cooking is insulted, or if a woman is harmed.That, or any time that he is in the same room with Zoro, who as mentioned before, has a rivalry with.Sanji is a good character.After Nami, he is the most level-headed of the crew, but he can still be an idiot sometimes.He is the third strongest in the crew, and like the first two, he has a strong code of honor.He constantly smokes a cigarette, which was changed to a lollipop in American versions of the manga/anime.Overall, I really liked this series.Its quite addicting, even though it is rather long.I read it in a week, which was only possible because I was under a bet and I kinda forgot about doing everything else during that time.I highly recommend reading this [But definitely at a slower pace than what I did.Maybe do like 2 volumes a night].I wish that i could have written a better summary, but its hard to do so with this manga without giving anything away.Maybe in a bit I'll go back, look it over, and rewrite it.Here are some pictures depicting some of the fights &ndash; these aren't the best in the series, nor are these comedy shots.Like I said earlier, the manga gets a lot better as it gets on, in terms of fights and comedy.I tried to not go too far into the manga so as not to ruin anything, but these pictures don't fully represent how good this manga is.Not only that, but the quality of the manga increases - another good part about it being so long is that you can see the artwork change over time.review taken from animeruwlez,

and setting are alright, the story and characters are forgettable and nothing more than a modern fan service for teens to relate to.Like" I want to touch some boobs" Will Power finally freaking do something?Denji fights are getting                  ...repetitive.It's the same thing over again.Hands down.Best character development is Power's, if you only consider becoming more and more useless a

              I am writing this review simply because there was only one review which means that no matter how bad this review is it will still end up being the second most helpful.Set in an alternate universe from previous parts as a result of the events at the end of Stone Ocean, Steal Ball Run is probably the apex of the massive Jojo's Bizzare Adventure franchise, which is no small statement.Araki has once again recycled and improved upon his formula for making terrifically bizarre adventures.The premise for Steel Ball Run like many of the other parts of the JJBA series is fairly simple and straightforward                  ...yet manages to go so far beyond the limits in depth and development of such a simple story.Essentially the story is about a cross-continental horse race across America with a prize of $50 million.There are many wacky and wonderful characters who enter this race ranging from a native american trying to save his village to a man who entered the race because he got a good fortune from a creepy fortune teller.Moving onto the two main characters of Steel Ball Run.We have Johnny Joestar the titular Jojo of the series and Gyro Zeppeli.In his youth Johnny was a promising horse jockey until he was shot and paralyzed which resulted in him being unable to compete, he also lost all his fame and his father's love as well.It's at this point Johnny encounters the flamboyant Gyro Zeppeli who Johnny believes holds the ability to restore his ability to walk, with nothing to lose Johnny pursues Gyro.Gyro whilst reluctant at first allows Johnny to race alongside him in the Steel Ball Run.Araki decided only to have two central characters in this part as opposed to previous parts such as Stardust Crusaders and Vento Aureo which results in both characters receiving brilliant development over the course of the series, this is hands down the best bromance in anime and manga.There are still many notable side characters present and they still play an important role in the plot, we have a magnificent cameo performance from previous villain Dio Brando in the form of the suave ladies man Diego Brando who is willing to do anything to achieve his ambitions.As well as the mysterious Hot Pants who provided one of the most shocking twists in the entire series.We then have the antagonist of the story Funny Valentine (named after the song 'My funny valentine' by Chet Baker) who happens to be the President of the United States and is the one secretly pulling the strings behind the scenes of the Steel Ball Run for his own nefarious means.Valentine manages to set himself apart from the other villains in the series and even manages to surpass his counterparts which is very impressive considering JJBA arguably has some of the best villains in any series.He manages to combine his strong philosophical and political views with perhaps the coolest ability of all time to become a truly great villain.Once more Araki's artistic style has evolved further, his eccentric character designs have been brushed up to the point of perfection.Since the series moved from Weekly Shounen Jump to Ultra Jump which has monthly release the length of the chapters has lengthened, as well as the quality of the backgrounds and landscapes which vary greatly across the massive continent of America from vast desserts to  frozen wastelands which are all captured beautifully.The Stand fighting system is back once more, but has been refined further.Araki once again provides the reader with a banquet of fabulous powers and intelligent fights that other fighting series could only wish for.A special mention to Diego Brando's 'Scary Monsters' because well it is awesome.Araki has really outdone himself this time.He has truly created one of the most exciting and memorable manga series of all time with Steel Ball Run, I have no idea how he plans to top himself with Jojolion but he has set the bar pretty damn high for himself and every other shounen author out there.I highly recommend this series to anyone looking for a fantastic series filled with intelligent and innovative fights, brilliantly developed characters who are genuinely relatable and for anyone who wants to read a series with horse races in it.If you are interested in reading Steel Ball Run you can probably get away with not reading the entire series from parts 1-6 but I would strongly advise you to check out the entire series as you would be missing out on a lot of greatness, at any rate you should at the very least watch the 2012 series as there are a few overlapping themes and characters which you should be aware of.Story=8.7Art=9.1Characters=9.5Enjoyment=10Overall=9.4        Reviewer’s Rating: 9What did you think of this review?Nice              0

             EDIT: As CSM is a very intense story which deals with a lot of graphic violence and difficult themes, I feel it's appropriate to provide some content warnings.Know that Chainsaw Man features child neglect/abuse, gore, vomiting, grooming/psychological manipulation, and pedophilia.Tread carefully!!EDIT 2 ELECTRIC BOOGALOO: THIS IS A REVIEW OF PART 1 ONLY!!!I'll probably end up appending a whole 'nother review about part 2 once it's wrapped b/c i'm down horrid for this manga.anyways enjoyyyyyyyyy--I hate reviews that start off with unnecessary prose, so let's skip all that and get to the meat of things!Chainsaw Man is a story which thrives in                  ...its unexpectedness.It's a story that takes you for twists and turns in its plot and characterization, but most effectively in its subversion of shounen tropes which gives the story a far greater effect.It's a story that looks dumb as hell, with a protagonist who acts dumb as hell, with a goal that seems dumb as hell (touch some booooooooobs).But where Chainsaw Man gets you is that it anticipates your exhaustion with these tropes.It anticipates that you'll accept the perverted protagonist, accept Denji's tragic backstory as only setting the scene for the start of the manga, accept the lack of culpability put on Makima for her actions in endangering a minor.Because all shounen protagonists are teenagers who go through horrible things, so who cares?Fujimoto does.Fujimoto cares.And he wants *you* to care, too, as he deconstructs tropes left and right, crafts beautiful, complex characters, and constantly ups the ante, all without creating a story so large it self destructs.PART 1: Don't Open the Door (Denji, the Plot, and Subverting Shounen Tropes)At the core of Chainsaw Man is its protagonist, Denji: a destitute, highly impoverished teen, who every day struggles to survive as he tries to pay off his late father's insurmountable debt to the yakuza.At his side is Pochita, his pet chainsaw devil.Denji is willing to do most anything to make a pretty penny, as is quickly established: cutting down trees, killing devils (which is highly dangerous), even selling body parts on the black market.Denji's life is tragic, but it is not meaningless.Unlike many shounen protagonists, his past of barely surviving on a piece of bread a day, with his father's impossible debt looming over his head, is not a set piece to merely established "hows" and "whys".It is not immediately forgotten as soon as he acquires his powers and gets the plot rolling.Instead, the lessons Denji has learned stick with him, in a way that is infinitely more authentic.When Denji joins the Public Safety Devil Hunters, it is not out of some higher mission.He frankly doesn't give a shit about killing devils to save people, or to prevent damage, or anything like that (at least, not at the beginning).It's a do or die situation: after being attacked by a devil, his devil dog, Pochita, saves his life by fusing with him, thus giving him chainsaw powers.When the local Public Safety force which protects Japan from devils arrive on the scene, Denji is faced with a choice: to die at their hands as a devil, or to live as a human and work with them, using his unique powers to become a devil hunter.Denji accepts, of course.But Denji does not hate Makima, the devil hunter who put him in this situation.Instead, he is grateful to her, because she hugged him and promised to feed him breakfast.Denji's life of tragedy doesn't exist just to make him easier to root for.It is a *core component* of who he is in a way that is incredibly compelling, as well as being more authentic to the actual real-world impact of severe trauma (especially childhood trauma).Every single one of his goals -- to eat good food, to have a friend to play video games with, to touch a girl's boobs, to have sex with a girl -- is a reflection of the loneliness and isolation he grew up in.Denji is blunt, and Denji is simple.The only things he wants are safety, a home, and a person who cares about him.In an incredibly refreshing twist, Denji's life of abject poverty and his role as a devil hunter are actively questioned and challenged.There are no other child or teenage Devil Hunters (Denji is 16 for the majority of the first part of the manga) who are "talented" or "smart" or whatever.It just isn't done.Denji is a special case, because he is a half-devil.He isn't treated like a normal teenager by the majority of the cast.But there is one character, halfway through the first part, who sees Denji for who he is.They sneak into a school together in the middle of the night to hang out.Partway through, Denji's new friend sombers, as they think more about Denji's circumstances."At 16, you're still just a kid, you know?It's when most kids are studying to get into college, throwing themselves into a club or a sport, hanging out with friends....But *you're* killing devils, almost getting killed yourself... Is this Public Safety place you're with right now really a good place?""Yeah, they're super great!I get three meals a day and I get to sleep in a bed.""That's, like, the *bare minimum* standard of living in Japan...It's *not* something amazing."Ah!How refreshing!!Another character acknowledging that Denji's situation is irrevocably fucked, and *specifically* because of his age!!!Of course, hurt/comfort and angst tropes have their place in shounen.But I've never seen a conversation like this, where a character tells the protagonist that not just one thing that happened is sad or fucked up -- that their whole situation sucks, actually, and why isn't anyone doing anything about it?(I love Fullmetal Alchemist dearly.I spent the entire manga and both anime waiting for ONE (1) person to acknowledge that being a child soldier at age 12 is Kinda Bad instead of impressive.)In a genre populated by underage protagonists tackling world-destroying threats, it's very refreshing to see this questioned.In the interest of avoiding spoilers, I'll refrain from going further into Denji's character and development.But just know that Denji is not a static protagonist, and his ridiculous quest in the first dozen or so chapters to touch a girl's boobs is not his defining trait.Generally speaking, I hate perverted protagonists!I think they're annoying as hell.But Denji isn't a pervert.He's a traumatized kid looking for connection with someone, anyone.And that, to me, is compelling.PART 2: Connections and Supporting CharactersThe supporting cast in Chainsaw Man is great, because they are all batshit crazy.One character acknowledges that you have to have a few screws loose to survive as a devil hunter.These characters -- many of whom aren't human -- act entirely outside the boundaries of normal behavior to survive as devil hunters.And yet they're all still realistic and compelling, with their own goals, relationships, personalities, and traits.They crack jokes and fight brutally, complain about paperwork and worry about the safety of themselves and their friends, act rationally and then pull the dumbest shit in the universe.This impulsivity only makes them feel more real, and lends to/enhances the frantic vibe of the story itself.Chainsaw Man features a *lot* of character death.Will your favorite survive to the end?Chances are, probably not!But despite that, somehow Fujimoto avoids exhausting readers with deaths.You know you shouldn't care, because there's no guarantee they'll live to the next chapter, but you still do.Some deaths are foreshadowed for entire chapters, while others happen entirely out of the blue.But regardless, each serves a purpose, and each is genuinely upsetting.Beyond that, each character develops and progresses naturally, where even your least favorites start to grow on you.(I hated Kobeni when I started reading Chainsaw Man.Now I would die for her.)They don't all progress in a positive way, but they are constantly changing.A true standout character in my eyes is Power.She's a fiend -- a devil possessing a human corpse -- who is a fellow devil hunter, and becomes one of Denji's closest friends.She's also a total bastard.Power is very unique in my eyes, because, yes, she's really cute and funny, but she's also an absolute moron.That's not very common in anime and manga, for female characters to just be idiots!Usually, a dumb female character is a cutesy airhead, and there's always this super creepy undertone of surrounding male characters "taking advantage of" her innocence (usually by making passes at her that she is cheerfully oblivious to).But Power is just as much of a jerk as Denji, if not more.They get up to antics together, prank their housemate Aki, riff off each other, and generally have an incredibly strong dynamic.It's really, really refreshing to see a female character whose gender doesn't limit her personality traits to only 'cutesy' feminine stuff!It's also really refreshing to see a 100% platonic dynamic between her and Denji.(Power is also a very compelling character herself, which I won't get into because Spoilers.)The characters also have incredibly compelling bonds and relationships, which are all the more powerful for how understated they are.Most characters in Chainsaw Man aren't the type to go on pages-long monologues describing exactly how they feel, or how they interpret their relationships with each other.It's through their actions that you can understand character dynamics, which really makes them shine.Again, in the interest of avoiding spoilers, I won't get into specifics.But I will say that the dynamic between Denji and Makima is one of the most crucial and compelling parts of the manga, and that reducing Denji to a simp really does a great disservice to both of their characters.I really wish I could ramble about all the characters in Chainsaw Man, because I love literally all of them (except Santa Claus and Makima.All my homies hate Santa Claus and Makima).But much of what makes them amazing can't be summed up in brief personality descriptions, and instead has to be read through their relationships with each other.For all the brashness and bluntness of the manga, there is a beautiful subtlety to the character development, which is best experienced, rather than told.PART 3: ArtThe art of Chainsaw Man seems to be a point of contention for many!Personally, I've always liked it.I find that Fujimoto's sketchy style lends to the feeling of urgency and dread as you're waiting for the next Big Thing to happen.Also, his expressions and grasp of anatomy is godlike.But the art *is* very sketchy, and sometimes his characters fall a bit out of proportion (especially on profile views).Where Fujimoto's art truly shines is in Chainsaw Man's many gory fight scenes and eye-grabbing panels.In general, Fujimoto's panel construction is incredible.You can definitely see that he's a huge film fan, with how he uses all sorts of different angles and layouts in an attempt to emulate famous cinematography.Chainsaw Man is not a story that happens to be a manga -- it takes advantage of all the perks of the medium, and does so beautifully.(God, it's going to look so good animated.Hype.)Although Chainsaw Man loves blood and guts, it's not super intense / detailed -- squeamish folks may want to tread carefully, but most people will probably be fine.The gore isn't gross, but it is fun and flashy.Character design-wise, Fujimoto really shines with designing the various devils, fiends, and half-devil hybrids, as well as making all the members of Public Safety stand out despite the somewhat simplistic designs and uniforms they all wear.(This series is also a goldmine of reaction pics, especially when Kobeni's on the page.)Overall, you can tell that Fujimoto believes in the ten-second principle -- most people spend only ten seconds looking at a panel before moving on.But his artistic chops can't be denied, especially when you're looking at the full-page or spread panels.PART 4: In SummaryTo finish this off, I want to say that Chainsaw Man is good as hell.It's a smart manga that is gory, painful, frequently hilarious, and will make you feel despair like you've never felt before.But beyond the blood, guts, gore, and sex, Chainsaw Man is at its core a story about trauma, and growth, and the connections you make with other people (for better or for worse).I wouldn't go so far as to call it a deconstruction, but if you're a shonen fan who's become a bit disillusioned with the genre, Chainsaw Man is a breath of fresh air.(Especially since as of December 14, 2020, when this review is being posted, the announcement for an anime AND a "part two" of the manga just dropped a few days ago.And part 2... oh boy howdy does it look good!)Don't be fooled: This story *hurts*.It's immensely tragic.One chapter was so sad and stressful that another mangaka had to take a week-long mental health break.I was basically comatose for an entire day after binge reading this.But, if you've got the time and energy to devote to it, Chainsaw Man is an incredibly unique experience that won't let you down.Reviewer’s Rating: 10What did you think of this review?Nice              0              Love it              0              Funny              0              Confusing              0

         Well this is an early review but from what i can see, it is truly worth to read.A common thing every hero vs demon lord manga has is the presence of an elf in the party.This manga can be dubbed as "After happily ever after" by showing us the life of the elf years and years after defeating the demon lord.This will truly be a change of pace for all the isekai type anime/manga fans.People should be ready to be hit in the feels with every chapter so i suggest everyone to keep some tissues with them while reading this one.Reviewer’s Rating: 10What did you think of this

           Some seinen manga, I believe, take the meaning too far.The gore and nudity found in them is simply disturbing, no longer artistic, just omnipresent and absolutely in-your-face.Vagabond is not like those seinen manga.From the beginning, Vagabond has this strange allure to it.Drawn to this manga by the promise of awesome fight scenes, [oh yes, I assure you, you will not be disappointed by the fight scenes], you find yourself hooked to this manga.Absolutely, completely, utterly, hooked.It starts off with a rather rude and yet beautiful jerk, depicting the scene of a battlefield in splendid watercolor.The manga just rides on from there, rising                  ...from peak to peak.The fights get better, and the character himself grows.He grows realistically, he stumbles, he falls, he falls so hard that he finds it difficult to get back onto his feet, he takes the wrong path, goes the wrong way, makes the wrong enemies, and kills the wrong people, but he gets back up, and the story continues.It is just so completely believable, so persuasive and so artistic all at the same time that with this manga just feels so raw and yet so real.The main character, who one will find it hard to identify with on the surface, has something deep within him that every single one of us can possibly understand and aspire towards.His growth and development, in more ways than just of the sword, but yet at the same time never truly leaving the sword, are so simple and yet so spectacular at the same time.He manages to bring out the best in some people and the worst in others, brushing past some like a whirlwind and crashing headlong into others, leaving behind a trail of death, destruction, and new life.All this happens while he himself is still growing, and while he is nowhere near perfect, there is just something so addictive about getting to know more about him.And getting to know more about the main character is exactly what this entire manga is about.It is about seeing Miyamoto Musashi through the eyes of the world, through the eyes of others, and through his own eyes.With a brilliant blend of flashbacks, flashforwards and glimpses into the lives of others besides those who surround the main character, Vagabond paints a rich picture of the samurai scene in the time of Miyamoto Musashi, the main character.If you have been hesitating about reading a seinen manga, hesitate no more.Vagabond will open your eyes to a brilliant new genre.Reviewer’s Rating: 10What did you think of this review?Nice              0              Love it              0              Funny

spoilers--- "Bruh"- Everyone that read the final chapter of AOT.Despite the underwhelming (or I could even say horrible) ending, Attack on Titan has been one of the best manga I have ever read.The manga has amazing well-written characters with the ability to generate some of the best character interactions I have ever seen in any story.The underground scene after the timeskip and the ability to dive deep into the psychology of each character is way too good.The ending is horrible I agree and it kinda breaks a lot of what has been built upon it so far but                  ...imo, the whole build up to ch.123 and some of the chapters in between are why I give it an 7/10.The characters themselves are what makes the manga special.I loved how unique the cast was, from the 2 best characters in the manga Reiner and Erwin (Eren was 1st before final chapter) to all the other side characters like Riko.They were so different and their ideologies were presented in a way that made you relate to them.A scene like Marco's death reveal is something I watch a lot simply because of how different it was and the nature of everything surrounding it.The cast was great which is why I understand how anyone could hate the manga for the way it ended.The plot was great as well, the manga's development from titan fights to deep human psychological battles and politics was brilliant.It felt natural and with time, the plot evolved and the characters evolved with it which is why it felt both natural and rewarding when seeing a certain fight or reaching a decisive point.Those were the reason I gave it a 9 or even a 10/10 at some point.On the other hand, the manga had way too many asspulls, some that even broke logic of the titans and their powers.There were way too many plot holes that didn't even get covered after the final chapter.You could have easily taken out like 10 out of the last 20 chapters and very little would have changed.All that combined with the ending tho, it falls down to an 7 tho I could easily give it less.The final chapter was that bad!Overall, I would give Shingeki no Kyojin an 7/10.Could have been a masterpiece but Isayama had other ideas.IDK if I would recommend it based on how bad the ending was.Reviewer’s Rating: 7What did you think of this review?Nice              0              Love it              0              Funny              0

(211/?chp)                                                   ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***It's not everyday you make an account on a site you lurk just to post a review, but here I am.Over-the-top entertainment, really easy to get into, great artwork, fun and likable characters.It’s no surprise this manga series is as popular as it is.Reading the author’s note on the first volume, it’s clear the author, Kohei Horikoshi, just wanted to create something fun and enjoyable, and he succeeded in doing so, at least in my opinion.So why the 4?Well, you see, this review focuses on the writing in this manga series, and I'm going to be as                  ...brutally honest as I can be about it.It seems weird to do so, since this manga isn’t trying to be anything more than it is.But you often hear so much about how great the writing in this manga is compared to other shounen manga series.God knows how many times I was told this before I decided to give it a read.But the reality is quite different.If I could compare the story to in this manga to something similar, it would be the Pokemon series.In every Pokemon saga prior to Sun & Moon, Ash will travel to a new region, run into some girl that decides to travel with him, meet a new rival that kicks his ass in almost if not all their encounters, gather all the badges in the region and assemble a Pokemon team, enter the Pokemon League where he finally bests his rival once and for all, ultimately lose the Pokemon League, and then it's back to square one with him traveling to another new region, where he runs into some girl, and you know the rest...In My Hero Academia's case, once Deku is accepted into U.A.High School, in order to become the greatest superhero, each arc starts to follow a pattern of Deku going to school, learning a new technique or gaining a new equipment, taking part in a test/exam with little to no consequences, a villain appears, a villain’s arrested, Deku goes back to school, learns a new technique, and well, you know the rest...The reason why I specifically chose the Pokemon series even though a lot of stories tend to have a set structure, is because no matter what events occurs, things always returns to the “status quo” with little to no impact on the world or the characters.Speaking on the world first, 80% of the population has superpowers (They call them 'quirks') and yet, such a phenomenon doesn't seem to have effected the world of MHA much.Only significant change is that being a superhero is now an occupation, other than that, the world is still so “normal”.Even then, we simply just don't know much about its world as a whole at all, and as such, this manga has one of the most vapid and shallow settings I have ever come across within the medium.I can only think of two locals, that being U.A.High School and Shiketsu High, the latter is by name only as it hasn't been touched on at all.I can't even be optimistic about it ever being explored in the future because U.A., which has been the only setting of importance in this manga so far, is barely expanded on as well.The author doesn't need to dive deep on every region in Japan or every country in the world but he can't even expand on the school that's the story's main environment and is also apparently a big deal within it's world?And because not much is known or seen about the world, it doesn't seem like anything that happens actually matters.Spoilers: later in the story, Japan's greatest hero loses his powers.They make a huge deal about it, saying there's panic among civilians, villains have started to emerge from the underground, and that other countries are in shock about the situation.But none of that is every felt.There's panic among civilians?Then why is every panel filled people just going on about their lives like nothing happened?Villains are coming back to the scene?Well, where are they?There’s only been one, and he got dealt with the same arc he’s introduced."America’s in uproar"?Why would anyone reading this care when we don’t know the relationship between the US and Japan?The only place we ever see this news have any effect is U.A.High School, with the students having to move to the dorms, but this doesn't shake the "status quo" as the students are still just going about their days as if nothing happened.Also, at times, some of these effects and rules within its society don’t make any sense.There's a character known as the Hero Killer who is attacking and killing heroes, and due to this, the cities he has visited in Japan have experienced a drop in the crime rate....I'm sorry but, what?He is actively preventing people from stopping crime and that somehow leads to a decrease in crime?But at the same time, his actions also lead to an uprising of villains?It's contradictory and doesn't make a lick of sense.And then when the students put him down, they are scolded for using their powers to defend themselves and to save a life, all because they don’t have a license?....Again, what?Another issue with this is, where was this rule when the students were freely using their powers to defend themselves against a horde of goons earlier in the story?World building seems like a lost cause in this manga.There’s barely any, and when it does try, it ends up being nonsensical or contradicted later on within the story.Regarding the characters, a lot of them have two things going for them, that being their characters designs and their likable personalities.Outside of that, we still don't know much about most of them.Not only that but majority of them don't seem to serve any purpose to the story.There are a lot of characters in this manga but the story seems to mainly revolve around Deku, Bakugo and Todoroki.And out of those three, I only find Bakugo interesting.Deku is already a model hero, in fact, I would argue he was already one from the beginning, only lacking confidence, which he's gained now.All he has to do now is gain full control of his god tier quirk, "One for All", and he'd be unstoppable, literally.Todoroki's whole character is about his daddy issues, which I've simply grown tired off because each time he's the main focus, it's the same story being retold each time about him having problems with his father and accepting his fire ability.There are a few side characters that are really fleshed out like Endeavor & Mirio, for example.But looking at majority of the characters there’s not much that can be said about them.I'll be focusing mainly on the students in Class 1-A.Many people will tell you that, in this class of 20, majority if not all of them are well fleshed out.If I asked someone to list just 5 things about Tokoyami, Jiro, Mineta, Kaminari, Ashido, Ojiro, Sato, Koda, Shoji, Sero, or Hagakure's character?Could they actually?Because I really doubt they could.Even then, for the characters that do get anything, those moments are very few.Momo's only had one, that being the time where she lost her confidence.Same with Iida's during the Hero Killer incident, and Ochako's during the Sports Festival.The argument to this is "we'll learn more about them in the future".And I mean, yeah, we might very well learn more about them later on, but I'm writing this in the present, based on what I've been told about them in the present.I'm not saying every character needs to have equal development and characterization, that’s impossible.But we just don't know much about majority of the characters in this manga, and the author keeps adding more and more characters each arc, who we learn little to nothing about, and ultimately don't do anything.Regarding the villains, the main ones are known as the "League of Villains".It's a similar case with Class 1-A where I doubt anyone can list 5 things about each of their characters.Add that in with how incompetent and weak they are and I feel like I'm just reading about an edgier Team Rocket.Two other villains I want to write on are the Hero Killer and Overhaul.The Hero Killer, called Stain, believes that heroes nowadays have a corrupt view and wants to change that, how?By going out and killing heroes.First of all, where are these corrupt heroes?They flat out don’t exist within the setting.Oh but well, Stain's definition of a corrupt hero includes people who get paid for it.Going by his logic, military soldiers, who risk their lives to protect their country, are corrupt because they get paid.How one could form such a ridiculous ideology, I don't know.Also, he has such an "awe-inspiring" ideology but doesn't bother voicing it to the public and instead believes serial killing is the best way to get across his message, as if anyone would ever see the difference between him and a normal serial killer.Another issue with this is, how was this ever going to change his society?What results did he expect to get from just going around and murdering heroes?I mean, the heroes aren’t just going to stop being heroes because of one guy.Soon or later, he was going to be put down, and he was, by students in training even.And on Overhaul, the easier way to describe him would be to call him a combination of the League of Villains and the Hero Killer.By that I mean, he's incompetent, stupidly putting so much trust in a group that he not only just met but also killed one of their members a few moments ago, and he also has a contradictory and nonsensical motivation where he creates quirk erasing bullets because he see them as a disease that must be cured, but also makes a serum that restores quirks, going against his ideology.Not to mention that unlike the Hero Killer, Overhaul is treated like a punching bag at almost every point, and after the manga just went on about how strong he was 4 chapters prior.Imagine if after all that hype, the Z-Fighters dealt with Vegeta and Nappa long before Goku arrived at the scene, or if Orochimaru was defeated by Team 7 when they first meet in the Forest of Death, or if Luffy beat Crocodile on his first try.That’s Overhaul.When it comes to the fights in this manga, they tell you more about the characters, it’s a way to learn more about them and also where their development takes place.That’s about the only positive thing I can say about them.Other than that, the fights are underwhelming for two of reasons: One, they don’t follow any logic and just have the characters constantly breaking rules previous set by the story itself or receiving a deus ex machina to resolve the battle.And two, the superpowers suck.A lot of the superpowers in this manga are bizarre which is actually a plus in my book.I mean, Sero is able to shoot tapes from his body, that's wacky and is something that I haven't seen elsewhere.But a lot of quirks are way too restricted rendered them useless.As I said, Sero can shoot tapes from his body, but actually he can only shoot tapes from his elbows, and as such, there's not much he can do with it.His quirk isn’t practical for battle and as such, he was one shotted so casually by Todoroki who just used him as a means to vent his frustration.And now that I think about it, why would anyone choose to have someone who shoots tape from his elbows protect them, when a pistol would easily outdo him?Another thing about the powers is that while they’re bizarre, it doesn’t mean anything if they aren’t or can't be used in a creative or bizarre way, which is the case with nearly every ability in this manga.Sero is one example of a character who's very limited in what he can do.Aoyama’s quirk is that he can shoot a laser from his stomach, it’s no surprise that he doesn’t get much action, and that the one fight he was in, he lost.Koda’s quirk is too situational, unless there just happens to be a lion running around the city nearby, he’s not going to be of any use at all.On the other hand, Todoroki’s quirk allows him to create ice from half his body, and fire from the other half, but watching him fight is always mundane because his moveset consists of just blasting ice from one side and/or fire from the other side.Iida has like two kicking techniques, the other just a faster version than the first.Kirishima can harden his body, and can, well, harden himself even more.Almost everyone uses their powers so one dimensionally because majority of the superpowers are heavily restricted despite being super basic, and thus fights are generally dull to read.In conclusion, while this manga is fun to read, I would be lying if I told you the writing is anything more than just barely competent, I mean it was already contradicting itself as early as the second chapter and that's a sign for what to expect from the writing in this manga.You could call it an average shounen but I've read Bleach and that one bothered to flesh out its setting and characters a little.Almost nothing in this manga is fleshed out, it’s all surface level and incredibly bland, so contrary to what people tell you, if you’re looking for a well fleshed out story, this isn't it.Reviewer’s Rating: 4What did you think of this review?Nice              0              Love it

real victim here.Me: No.Creator: Yes.And the main couple will be super inconsistent.Like in every other chapter they kiss and love and then the next one they be like "why don't you go bang some other lesbian and die."No: Me.Me.No.What?Creator: Yes.And it will have at least two love triangles around both main characters.Me: No.Creator: Oh, and did I mention all of these love triangles will consists of just girls?No guys will be present.Me: ....I kinda guessed.Citrus is the worst lesbian series I have yet read.It constantly rubs the lesbian into reader's face in a same manner as ecchi series shove boob jiggling down the throat.This would be great of course if the characters weren't so full of shit.The other girl pretty much looks like the hoe at your local high school who trades sex for cigarettes.The another is exponentially worse.If she was a he, this series would be tagged as a pro-rape propaganda and tumblr would have to expand its server capacity.The inconsistent romance in this is not pretty to watch.Whenever the sexually assaulting sister is not in the mood for kissing and boob fondling, she is in angst, and every bit of her dialogue during these moments could be replaced with "yes, I do have a licence to drive a truck" and the conversation had would still make as much sense.The pacing is terribad and the series so long only because the characters are idiots who ponder over the same questions for half the eternity, only to choose the most obvious outcome without changing much at all as characters during the run.Apparently, all of their bs can be excluded completely by making a vow.Who needs character development and believability when implied happily ever after is an option, too.The story is nothing but an excuse for our characters to act like the clowns they are.The art is rather boring.Outside the mediocre characters, not much is often even drawn on the panels.Background art is either a myth or otherwise nonexistent 50% of the time.I rather suggest reading the cute and 2pure5thisworld lesbian romances, such as "Stretch" and "Tamen De Gushi".Or alternatively cute with passionate sex, such as "Prism" and skip this nonsense.Reviewer’s Rating: 2What

(All reviews)      Aug 17, 2019sumchiNot Recommended                 ***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***"Didn't you see the statement?Sangwoo smashed Bum's legs with a hammer, and slashed his skin with a knife.Not to mention the beatings.If Bum still loves him after that, that's not love.Its an illness."- Seungbae to Lee, about Bum's Stockholm Syndrome.Okay.Let's just get this outta the way, because this needs to be said.Killing Stalking isn't a Yaoi that is supposed to be romanticized in any way or form, it's a Psychological Thriller which depicts Abuse, Torture, Rape, Homophobia, Pedophilia and Incest.DON'T read this if you were a victim of any kind of abuse, it's very                  ...triggering.Killing Stalking is not a romance, aight.The Author herself had to go out of her way to state that back in 2017 because of the sickos who romanticize this.Garbage like Tiktok (Anitiktok, romanticizing kidnapping, abuse, and rape, fetishizing mlm relationships, sexualizing children...🤡) unfortunately gives the toxic fans the opportunity to spread misguided sh*t, romanticizing a Domestic Abuser, Rapist and Serial Killer (Sangwoo).Even Roblox and Gacha have KS content and that's literally for kids lmao.We're talking about a Psychological Thriller for 18+ here, not some "uwu soft boys" shit.If you romanticize Sangwoo then you're not all there in the head and need to get of of your edgy teenager phase asap.Seeing so many people romanticize the abuse that gets lashed out on Bum is just beyond disrespectful to people irl who have to go through such events or are currently going through it.It's traumatizing, not some "uwu, i wish he breaks my legs".Bum gets beaten, tortured, raped, dehumanized and manipulated by Sangwoo.Something as graphic/triggering as KS should have never hit the Mainstream scene and you can easily tell so when all the fanbase is made out of, are 13 yrs olds with the same ankles "joke", as if it was ever the Author's intention to make a joke out of abuse (Not even going into the fact that the fandom makes fun of the scene when Sangwoo raped Bum, but then have the nerve to be mad at Bum's Uncle for raping Bum, JUST like Sangwoo??)If you haven't read KS, then you probably still heard things like "Sangwoo is so hot and so are his actions, Bum and Sangwoo had relationship goals, those who hate this just misunderstood the whole context of their relationship" from the fandom.Even when you tell them that fiction affects reality, they always come with the same "I watched a horror movie but that doesn't mean I want to murder people" argument, completely missing the point.Just because it's fiction doesn't mean that you have to condone problematic sh*t, like shipping a victim together with his Abuser and Rapist cuz when you're spreading that it’s okay to romanticize fictional abuse and rape, you are setting a precedent.You are leaving the impression that you think that abuse and rape is okay, and that is DANGEROUS.In this case, it also means victims of abusive relationships have to sit through watching romanticized portrayals of abuse and seeing it be normalized, causing them to be more likely to overlook signs of abuse in their relationships.Another nauseating thing is, is how easy it seems for the shippers to minimize what Sangwoo did to Bum (Severe physical abuse, serial rape and multiple killing attempts), yet they think that "good therapy" will fix them and then they can happily live together, as if that would erase the abuse that Sangwoo lashed out on Bum, the fact that Sangwoo kidnapped, tortured and killed innocent people for years, and the fact that Sangwoo is homophobic and doesn't love anybody but himself cuz he's a Narcissist.Just because Bum began to suffer from Stockholm Syndrome and put up with the abuse, doesn't mean that it isn't toxic.Downplaying what Bum went through by saying how he "willingly" stayed couldn't be more wrong.Bum got his legs broken so that he couldn't escape and whenever he tried to escape, it always failed and he got abused more.Are we just gonna ignore that Bum outright said that he prefers being with his abusive rapist uncle, over being with Sangwoo?He prefers being abused and raped every day over being with Sangwoo, that's how horrible Sangwoo is.Bum's brain made him develop Stockholm Syndrome as a self mechanism.Stockholm Syndrome=emotional response that happens to some abuse victims where they develop positive feelings towards their abuser.There's nothing romantic about that.It's messed up and sad.Even the more mature fans of this fandom are ridiculous:Sangwoo: *Breaks Bum's legs by shoving him down the stairs and breaking the other one with a sledgehammer, abused, manipulated, raped and tried to kill Bum throughout the entire story, is homophobic, confirmed to be straight, and a sociopathic narcissist, he lacks empathy, proving by the fact that the abused, raped and killed people for yrs without remorse, only kept Bum alive to use him as substitute of his mom, tried to kill Bum multiple times as well as in the end*Them: "I think Sangwoo developed feelings for Bum in the end uwu"Sure.It's not like abuse and rape are the cruelest things you can do to another human being.It's not like he's homophobic and used Bum as a substitute and never cared about Bum himself since he just abused, raped and used him."Oh, then the Author shouldn't have made Sangwoo so attractive then” THE WHOLE POINT IS FOR HIM TO BE ATTRACTIVE CAUSE PEOPLE WILL OFTEN FORGET/FORGIVE SOMEONE OF DOING BAD THINGS JUST BCUZ THEY'RE ATTRACTIVE.That's who Ted Bundy was, he used his looks to kidnap, rape and kill women and children.The WHOLE POINT with Sangwoo is that he's tricking people with a fake facade and then kidnaps them, breaks their legs, abuses them for days and kills them.Sangwoo would do the same things to his fans faster than they could count to ten, he's not some "edgy anime husbando uwu", he's a Textbook Abuser, Rapist and Serial Killer+Misogynist and Homophobe.And then you got bad takes in the fandom like: "Bum would've been the villain if Sangwoo was a regular guy" And it's like...?The only reason why there was a story to begin with, is because of what Sangwoo is.In a scenario where Sangwoo was a regular guy, he wouldn't have broken Bum's legs, kidnapped him, and verbally abused him for the entire story.So there would've been no story.So how tf would Bum have been the villain instead in a alternative scenario?Are we talking about the same Bum?Bum who loves frogs and is is hyper empathetic?Bum who self hams and always blames himself?Bum who didn't even want his rapist uncle to die?Bum who sympathizes with his abusers?Bum who wants to harm nobody?How is he villain material??I-🤦‍♂️ Like ffs, just because Bum isn't completely innocent (nobody is) doesn't mean that he's villain material.A villain is someone who is evil or who causes harm.Bum is nothing like that.This review is from the perspective of someone who was once a fan and it contains spoilers, so beware.I remember reading it back in Early 2017 and following it till it ended in 2019.I was quite intrigued by it in the beginning and I read all chapters which were out at the moment in one night, which was like, the first season, I think?My opinion to it changed over time however.First of all, the fanbase is one of the worst, toxic fandoms of all time.Shipping a narcissistic Serial Killer, Abuser and Rapist with the victim is a big yikes.Sangwoo Stans and Shippers don't care though.Many of the Sangwoo stans even went so far to victimblame Bum for Sangwoo's actions.Sangwoo kills people?They ignore that.Sangwoo beats and rapes Bum?They ignore that.Sangwoo blames Bum for everything?They ignore that.But as soon as Bum stands up for himself, they hate on him and blame him for everything, and that always made me SICK to my stomach.Bum was the one who was always there for Sangwoo.Bum was the one who always cheered him up and sympathized with him throughout the whole story.Bum was the one who just wanted a normal relationship.Bum was the one who always blamed himself when Sangwoo abused him.Bum was the one who always apologized.Bum was the one who always comforted Sangwoo even though Sangwoo never showed Bum any sympathy.Even near the end, when Sangwoo screamed at Bum and attempted to strangle him to death, Bum comforted Sangwoo, with Sangwoo ending up blaming Bum, again.People who glamorize Sangwoo, glamorize people like Ted Bundy and the Murderers of Junko Furuta and I'm wondering if Hybristophilia is the reason for that cuz I can't, by any stretch of the imagination, see, why anybody would fangirl over a Serial Killer and Rapist and ship him with the person who gets beaten and raped by him.Sangwoo BROKE Bum's legs.He BEATS Bum.He TORTURES Bum.He MANIPULATES Bum.He RAPES Bum.He attempts to KILL Bum multiple times.He BLAMED Bum for getting RAPED by his uncle.He then SICCED said uncle on Bum.He uses Bum as REPLACEMENT of his mom.He NEVER showed Bum any sympathy.Sangwoo HATES gay people.The Art isn't bad, it's one of the few things that carried the manhwa, but there were many panels were characters wouldn't have faces/facial details were missing (Sangwoo's eye disappears often...for no reason?Bum's Uncle doesn't even have eyes, only his eyebrows are there which looks ridiculous) or the Author would sometimes forget things in the panels, so that just came off as lazy to me.Sangwoo's eyebrows look like they wanna fly off his goddamn forehead, idk how someone could call those eyebrows lmao.The backgrounds were also lazy/boring as hell, looking back at it, you got like these heavily filtered photos while objects are obvious 3D models which look SO out of place.And while the Art itself became better with each season, I prefer Season 1's art style over the later ones, it suits the atmosphere perfectly.Something I also noticed were the numerous, unnecessary panels.Both of their bodies were massively fetishized.Bum's body for example.The thin, gangly limbs with skin hanging off seems to be a constant point of sexualiation, from his underwear to how his body is framed in the sexual scenes.Like, yeah he's malnourished, but he's thin everywhere EXCEPT his ass and thighs.There are so many panels where Bum is in “sexy” compromising positions, it's as if the Author was not even trying to hide that they fetishize physical abuse.The whole rope scene from Chapter 8 where Sangwoo hangs Bum and almost kills him, was literally Torture Porn.The scenes where Sangwoo rapes Bum are framed as if Bum enjoys it towards the end, and it's never truly framed as rape within the series.Take Chapter 35 for example.Bum gets beaten, doesn't consent, gets raped, bleeds and screams "stop" and "no", yet in the next chapter it ends up with him being happy with it and not feeling ashamed, as if it wasn't rape even though he was clearly raped.It also simply got worse with the sexualization down the line.S3 has SO many unnecessary, weird and sexual scenes.The Author destroyed the potential of a good Psychological Thriller by throwing all these random moments in that do nothing, but fetishize weirdass sh*t. Abuse and rape aside, it was generally just uncomfortable to look at.Bum is older than Sangwoo but looks like a malnourished kid while Sangwoo looks like a grownass man.And idk if it's just personal preference, but like..Sangwoo isn't even attractive to me.From him looking like a racoon, to his weird eyebrows, to his ugly face, Seungbae is just way more attractive imo.Anyways.The MC Yoon Bum was a interesting and tragic character and I genuinely pity him more than any other tragic fictional character, however, Sangwoo was the definition of a typical, generic Serial Killer with Mother Issues.Sangwoo in the beginning was at least a little interesting although already highly unlikable due to being a abusive shitbag, but when his past got retconned with him now turning out to have have Mother Issues instead of what we were told, I was...disappointed?Disappointed that it was something so cliché.Especially because S3 was the worst season because the Author dragged Sangwoo's past for dozens of chapters and left more questions than it answered.S3 generally lacked the tension S1 had due to that."Mother Issues" is a Serial Killer trait that has been sucked dry since ages, the Author tried way too hard to make Sangwoo look smart that it got ridiculous, with the police being undoubtedly stupid just to make Sangwoo look like the "manipulative, charismatic Serial Killer" stereotype, basically Ted Bundy but fictional.It gets more ridiculous the more you think of it.Sangwoo somehow has the time to be at college, work as a bartender, workout and maintain his body, AND kidnap, torture and kill his victims and get rid of their bodies.He comes off as such a unrealistic character who shouldn't have the time for all those things but he does because the Author demands it.There is no reason for why he started kidnapping, abusing, raping and killing people, other than him taking his anger out on innocent people nor why is there a reason why he's homophobic.All the Side Characters were bland and forgettable and make you cringe due to their stupidity.Even the police were beyond useless.They had a mountain of evidences for Sangwoo's crimes but every single one of them apparently had the intellectual capacity of a 3 year old.Seungbae deserved way more love, he was the only cop with common sense, saved Bum, and fought for the justice of all the people Sangwoo has murdered, yet he gets hated on.Basically, Killing Stalking brings nothing new to the table.You got the whole creepy rapist uncle trope, you got the whole serial killer with mother issues trope, you got the whole stupid police with that one underdog cop trope, it was just really cliché.Yoon Bum (I feel like a better pic for him could be used here, him smiling is ooc, especially when it's from a scene where's being forced to do it so it ain't genuine) is the Main Character.From a writing standpoint, he was probably the only decent, original character in this.He's a shy, pitiful loner type guy who struggles socially and is a victim of severe abuse and tragedy throughout his whole life.Ngl, he had the most saddest life I've seen in fiction.Even Guts' (Berserk) backstory with Gambino and Donovan didn't hit me that hard.Bum's very easy to empathize with and I think that was the Author's intention since nothing good ever happened to Bum, he lost his parents when he was a kid and was violated by not just one, but multiple people throughout his life.He was regularly starved, beaten and emotionally abused by his uncle, then his uncle began to regularly rape him on top of that for years, he never had friends, he was bullied in school, he got constantly sexually abused in military and then Sangwoo put him through hell.Everyone in the story treated Bum like sh*t. From his uncle, to Sangwoo, to the bullies in school, to the guys in military, to Jiuen, to Yoon Jae, to that one Taxi Driver in the last chapter, to random people on the street, everyone had it out for Bum for no reason and yet he has still so much empathy for other people despite the fact that everyone in his life has used, bullied, abused, or raped him.I liked the way the Author showed how Bum's Obsession slowly turned into Stockholm Syndrome due to Sangwoo abusing him.Besides his PTSD and Stockholm Syndrome, Bum suffers from Borderline Personality Disorder and as someone who suffers from BPD myself, the way Bum acted-or-reacted during the story hit me hard.The Author did a good job at showcasing Bum's BPD.The easiest way to describe BPD, is that people who suffer from it, are hyper-empathic, extremely sensitive to the emotions and energy of people, animals, and to the elements in the environment.They experience emotions intensely which can lead to them obsessing over things, may it be over how they look, what they eat or over a person they love.It's different for everyone, but most of the people who suffer from BPD experience it unintentionally often.Bum, who lost his parents and got verbally abused by his uncle, bullied school and sexually abused in military, gets easily attached when shown affection for once.Another few symptoms are Fear of Abandonment, Unclear Self-Image, Self-Destructive Behaviors, etc.Those I mentioned can also be seen in Bum throughout the story.The reason WHY Bum became obsessed with Sangwoo at first makes completely sense as Sangwoo saved him from a rape attempt in military once, that was however before Bum knew Sangwoo's true nature.Even his lack of needed education from his parents was shown.In Chapter 26, the flashback chapter about Bum's traumatized past due to his uncle, he was shown holding a spoon in the wrong way, he didn't even know how to normally hold a spoon.Many people with BPD also state that they feel like a kid/have a childlike behavior, which is definitely the case for Bum since he's naive, shy and insecure and being open/honest about expressing his feelings (His surprised look when seeing a amusement park for the first time for example, it was such a innocent reaction).He also suffers from Social Anxiety which the Author showcased well, in Chapter 15 and 24 for example, with Bum's intense fear when people stare at him.This is also showcased in his nightmare chapter, when the movie played his traumatic experiences while the audience laughs at Bum's trauma of his uncle's sexual abuse on him (It's unfortunately common in real life that male rape victims and their trauma aren't taken seriously).I appreciate Koogi showing little traits about Bum throughout the story, without it being related to the story, his love for frogs for example which Bum adores since childhood (Wearing a cap with a frog symbol on it as a kid, being happy when finding a frog when hiking, fondly holding the frog keychain with both hands, etc) or how much he appreciates gifts, like when he held the frog keychain with both of his hands and panicked when he thought that he lost it which totally makes sense because it was the first present he ever got.It's the little things like these, that make a character, feel real.The first chapter already showed that Bum doesn't know the definition of love due to his upbringing, he considers any affection he gets for once in his life as a sign of love, that's why he fell in love with the girl during his high school time who was the first person who Bum had a connection with, and then Sangwoo, who saved Bum from a rape attempt (Before Bum knew who Sangwoo really is).Bum's BPD and "desire" for affection made him the perfect victim in Sangwoo's eyes who verbally abused Bum in an attempt to completely break Bum psychologically.Now, this wasn't confirmed by the author but I'm PRETTY sure that the constant sexual abuse that was lashed out on Bum made him hypersexual.Hypersexuality is a common symptom of sexual abuse during childhood, as well is it a symptom of BPD, which Bum suffers from.So since Bum was regularly raped by his uncle for years and sexual abused in military, it's likely that he became hypersexual as a Result of Rape Trauma Syndrome (RTS).This is just another thing that causes him to be manipulated so easy.It's honestly sad asf.No cap, I felt so bad for him the entire time, Bum lost both of his parents at the same day and was abused by EVERYONE during his life, he went through so many traumatic experiences where he was abused and raped, and all he ever wanted was for someone to love him for once.And y know what makes it even sadder?Bum was being used as a replacement for his own mother by his uncle for years.So I can't imagine what went through his head when he realized later on, that that was what he was to Sangwoo as well, a replacement.I'm saddened by how much the romanticization of a character like Sangwoo, has hurt Bum's character.Because Bum is by far the most original and well written character in the story, yet whenever Killing Stalking is brought up, it's always about Sangwoo.Sangwoo edits, Sangwoo fanarts, Sangwoo Apologists, seriously the amount of nausea I feel about the fact that a rapist character like him gets romanticized, is immense.Sangwoo is clichê and unlikable, he fails as a villain and as a character, is so vile that he's worse than a child rapist, and we never got any explanation as to why he's homophobic or why he abuses, rapes, and kills people.Why does he molest corpses?Why does he hate gay people?We don't know.But as for Bum, eveything about his character is well done.Everything about his character, from his BPD to his Anxiety, makes sense, he's one of the best, morally grey characters that I've seen, yet he's so underrated.Sangwoo is only romanticized because of his looks, if he looked like Bum's uncle, he wouldn't even have a single fan.My final opinion about Bum?He's overall a incredibly well written, morally grey character.While not completely innocent, he's a saint compared to Sangwoo, he doesn't want to hurt anyone and is a very empathetic and sensitive person, as seen by his self harming and him empathizing with his Abusers, his uncle and Sangwoo.Although both Bum's Uncle and Sangwoo abused Bum in every way, Bum didn't want his uncle to die, he was understandably afraid of him and with Sangwoo, Bum kept trying to see the good in him and was always there for him DESPITE everything Sangwoo did to Bum.He also sympathized with the girl from his high school time and was on good terms with her when they met again in the present.And when he noticed the bruises on her wrist and she told him that her boyfriend abuses her, he let her cry her heart out and sympathized with her.He was also never angry at Yoon Jae who bullied him nor did he have grudge against his superior in the army in military who regularly sexually abused him.I feel like what I especially like about him is how despite how little he thinks of himself, he's a survivor.Does he self harm?Yes.Does he almost always blame himself?Yes.But considering what we know about what he already went through before the story, his mental state has to be ridiculously strong.I can't imagine staying alive for so long if I were him.And in the end, Bum stepped over his own shadow and saved Seungbae from Sangwoo.Not to mention the scene where he angrily told his uncle that he's not his mom (Ex of his uncle) or the scene where he got angry at Sangwoo when he killed his uncle without every having asked Bum if he wanted his uncle dead in the first place.He stood up to his Abusers.I'll always adore Bum's character and I don't think I'll ever sympathize with a tragic character as much as I did with Bum, he was realistic and just pitiful and he deserved a better fate.Fun fact(?): There is a certain genuineness behind Bum's name.Yoon Bum means "Emotional Gift" which I think suits Bum's character perfectly.Also, idk if it's just me but Bum and Hooni (Protagonist from the Manhwa "Suicide Boy") are quite similar.Both have no parents (Bum's parents died while Hooni's mother died of illness while his father abandoned him), both are being bullied, both are depressed, both self harm, both get easily attached, both live in a apartment which they can hardly take care of, both are small, have black hair, eye bags and a fragile build, both get easily flattered, both love cute things, etc.If you're wondering why Bum didn't try to escape anymore after S1, it's because of multiple factors.1.Bum has been victim of abuse throughout his entire life, with nobody ever helping or saving him.2.He suffers from BPD and Stockholm Syndrome, so he's constantly confused about how to feel about the situation he's in.Sangwoo abuses and rapes Bum, then he's being "kind" for once, then he abuses Bum in every way again, rinse and repeat, so Bum puts up with the abuse, thinking that it's worth it for the little affection that he gets sometimes.3.Whenever he tried to escape, Sangwoo beat, tortured, and almost killed him.When Bum told people that he was kidnapped, they didn't believe him.And Sangwoo broke Bum's legs with a goddamn sledgehammer, so of course Bum would be afraid of being abused as punishment by him again.4.Jiuen's Death.Sangwoo planned her death, so that Bum wouldn't try to escape again.After her death, Sangwoo blamed Bum and Bum stopped trying to escape cause Sangwoo blackmailed him.5.Learned Helplessness.It's a state that occurs after a person has experienced a stressful situation repeatedly.They start to believe that they are unable to control or change the situation, so they do not try, even when opportunities for change become available.Considering that Bum was always abused by everyone around him, he simply stopped trying to escape, even when he had the chance to, since he felt like it was no use.Sangwoo is the second Protagonist, the Main Antagonist.The ultimate cringeworthy "im14andthisisdeep" TikTok girl magnet.He was terrible.Not just as a person but also the way he's written.He was boring and cliché.Your typical Serial Killer with Mother Issues.He wasn't just one of the worst written characters I've ever encountered, he's also the worst piece of shit in the history of manhwa and makes even Griffith from Berserk look like a good person.I despise him as a character and as a person, and his stans didn't make it any better.Dude's a narcissistic, homophobic Abuser, Mass Murderer and Rapist, yet you got sickos excusing his behavior.It's the Ted Bundy Situation all over again.His Fangirls think that Looks=Good so they ignore/deny the fact how he kidnapped, beat, tortured and killed women or beat, tortured and raped Bum.Endeavor from MHA is/was hated by everyone cuz he abused his wife and kid, yet Sangwoo, another Domestic Abuser who is a hundred times worse and beyond redemption since the beginning, is beloved by people who ignore his personality, but are in for his looks, despite him being the equivalent of human garbage.I can admit that there was also more to him though, although it never changed my opinion over him, he was a vile abuser to the very end and his death wasn't as satisfying as it should have been.It's ridiculous how people think that a "sad" past (I honestly gave no sh*t about his flashback, nothing of it explained why he abuses, rapes and slaughters people or why he's homophobic) justifies Sangwoo's abuse on women, his severe abuse on Bum, and his serial killings.His past may be seen as an EXPLANATION, but not as an EXCUSE.An abusers own trauma does not excuse or validate the trauma they inflict on others.Trauma doesn't and will never, give you a free pass to abuse, rape and kill others like Sangwoo does.I don't give a damn about his past just as much as I don't give a damn about the past of Bum's abusive uncle (Who also had a "sad" past).Fact of the matter is that both are Abusers and Rapists, they chose to abuse others for their own sadistic pleasure.Sangwoo is exactly like the uncle and worse on top of that, both are Abusers/Rapists and use Bum as replacement for a woman.Sangwoo doesn't just kill women, he's also totally fine with killing men and children, as seen when he killed the man from the gay bar, then Officer Park, and also left a child to freeze to death.Koogi never showed us how his kidnapping, abuse and serial killings started, he just did it because he felt like it and that's what throws me off, it's poor writing.His past was retconned in S3 and then we didn't even get a explanation why his mom was like the way she is, she just was cray cray for the sake of it, which makes her come off as a one dimensional character.For example, Albert Fish, a real life Serial Killer, Rapist and Cannibal had a fucked up past, but I don't ever have seen anyone excuse his actions.Why?Cuz the dude was a major piece of shit and ugly.Sangwoo is a piece of shit, but he ain't ugly, so everyone starts apologizing his crimes just because of his looks, being hypocritical.Sangwoo would immediately get the death penalty if he was real, he's that much of a bastard.I disliked Bum's uncle just as much, sure, but a Abuser, Rapist and Serial Killer (Sangwoo) is morally worse than a Abuser and Rapist (Bum's uncle).People glamorizing serial killers isn't rare, Ted Bundy's fangirls are the best examples and that was because of his looks.If Sangwoo was a ugly mofo like Bum's Uncle, then nobody would give a flying fuck about him.Any kind of Abuser, Rapist or Mass Murderer can go die in a hole.^And to everyone who thinks "oH bUT wHAt aBoUT tHiS aNd tHaT, iT wAs sTiLL a rELaTiOnsHiP" Please grow up.Sangwoo is hetero and homophobic, so he's obviously not into Bum.At times when he wasn't physically abusing Bum, he was manipulating him, not being sweet.That's common in abusive relationships, they're manipulating their victim so they stay with them.The amusement park and skiing?It was him grooming Bum for his uncle's death and Sangwoo raped Bum again when they went skiing.Koogi also foreshadowed Sangwoo sending Bum's uncle messages during that time since that was revealed later.Sangwoo is also a sociopathic, narcissistic Serial Killer, so it was for sure that he'd try to kill Bum again.Remind you, Sangwoo broke Bum's legs and locked him up, beat him up for accidently dropping a plate, beat him up again when Bum tied to escape and then hang Bum in the basement, nearly drowned him and cut his chin, forced Bum to talk about his traumatizing past with his uncle and blamed Bum for getting raped by his uncle which broke Bum and made Bum attempt suicide, nearly drowned Bum just because Bum was feeling uncomfortable, lied to and manipulated Bum, raped Bum several times, brought Bum's uncle to Bum and let him beat up and nearly rape Bum again, kept physically abusing Bum and tried to kill Bum in the end again.It was a shithole of traumatizing experience for Bum who was already enough traumatized from his uncle's abuse and what happened to him in military.Sangwoo lost every chance of Redemption at the moment he broke Bum's legs.Bum was just too naive, mentally ill, still obsessed with the Sangwoo who saved him in military, and suffered from Stockholm Syndrome.Bum was walking on eggshells the whole time, he was afraid for his life and always had to do things that please Sangwoo, his Abuser, so that he doesn't get abused or killed by him.No, Sangwoo doesn't suffer from Lima Syndrome (Kidnapper falling in love with captive).He never gave a shit about Bum, abused, tortured, manipulated and raped him and only saw Bum as replacement which was confirmed by the Author in her notes.You can easily tell so as in the end, he began beating and sexually abusing Bum again, used Bum as bait to kill Seungbae, then beat Bum in front of Seungbae when he refused to kill Seungbae and was about to kill Bum had it no been for Seungbae saving Bum (Bum, with folded hands, was repeatedly BEGGING Sangwoo to not kill him, but Sangwoo was seconds away from stabbing Bum to death).Sangwoo has always been "attracted" to Bum for his resemblance to his mother, not because of any actual male characteristics about him.It's important to remember the incidents where Sangwoo raped Bum as a way to punish/control him.Bum was a vessel for Sangwoo to enact his cruel fantasies of hurting his mother on.The sex was never about him being attracted to Bum himself in any way, shape, or form.Rape is never about sex, it's about power and Sangwoo was clearly not attracted to Bum, he even mixed his memories and thought Bum said things that actually were said by his mother.Bum was just a replacement for Sangwoo's mother.If Bum looked more "manly", then Sangwoo would've already killed him in the beginning of the Manhwa.Sangwoo was only selfishly using Bum in every abusive way and even told Bum that Bum should kill himself if he ever dies.Sangwoo is such a toxic asshole that I find even pure evil characters like the Joker more sympathizing than him.No, Sangwoo would never change.He's a narcissistic and sociopathic Serial Killer and Abuser.Abusers do not change.What he did when he didn't physically, mentally or sexually abuse Bum is called "love-bombing", literally grooming, because he was always trying to lure him back under his control.He'll make any and all promises he has to make and pretend to be different for a few weeks or months, and then slowly but surely go back to his old ways just as soon as he thinks he's got Bum locked down again.All those promises Sangwoo ever did were nothing but empty bullshit.He wanted to psychologically break Bum.He wanted Bum to be traumatized, angry, sad, crying after Jieun's death, anything but nothing.When he didn’t get the response he wanted, he got angry and threatened Bum.When Sangwoo forced Bum to talk about his past and Bum confided in Sangwoo about his uncle repeatedly raping him, Sangwoo gave no shits about showing empathy to Bum, he insulted him (He called Bum a "filthy rag", which means slut.Yes, Sangwoo called Bum a slut for getting constantly raped as a child by his uncle) and blamed Bum, saying that Bum wanted it, that it was his fault.This caused Bum to basically kill himself by cutting his wrists.Sangwoo realized that he went too far so when Bum woke up, he started acting nice again and said that it wasn’t his fault.But Sangwoo didn’t actually care.He only said that to keep Bum under his control again.It’s a cycle of love and abuse that keeps victims under the abuser’s control.Sangwoo knew exactly what to say to keep Bum in his claws.He hurts him by saying “you wanted it” and then tries to keep Bum in love with him by changing his answer to “it’s not your fault.” Yet, seconds later, he attempted to drown Bum in the bathtub.Something I remember from S3 is when Sangwoo said "She told me to the die the most painful death" and I was actually wondering at first if I was supposed to take it seriously.But nope.The Author really just wrote that in.She expected the Reader to show sympathy to someone who abuses, rapes and kills people with no remorse.Sangwoo never showed sympathy to his victims nor to Bum who he regularly abuses and manipulates (Alongside blaming Bum for getting raped by his uncle), but the Author actually expected me to sympathize with Sangwoo.Okay, lmao.The attempt sure failed, I actually couldn't believe that people fell for such lazy writing.I don't see WHY the Author expects the Reader to sympathize with a character who has been a piece of sh*t for 99% during the story.I'm not sure if it's because of how common it is in Yaoi, that the Seme is a Rapist, but it either way ain't good writing.^ALSO, even here, there are people who think that Sangwoo didn't rape Bum even though he did so several times.Chapter 20 for example.Or when a manipulated Bum saved Sangwoo's ass at the police station and Sangwoo beat Bum up once they got home and raped him while Bum screamed, bled, and repeatedly told him to stop.Chapter 35.During the skii chapters as well, he bit Bum and raped him who again, screamed and told him to stop.Chapter 43.I'm guessing people think that he didn't rape Bum because he ain't ugly like Bum's Uncle.Pretty Privilege.It's either way sad how delusional people can be.Reminds me of the whole "it's not rape if the rapist isn't ugly" ideology that some people have and it's disgusting.My final opinion about Sangwoo?I felt nothing but disgust towards him during the entire read-through until the end and he deserved his death.What he did the entire time was so extreme that when his past got revealed, it didnt work on me as a counterweight to the atrocities he commited and the awful behaviour towards poor Bum.It doesn't help that his past was a cakewalk compared to what Bum went through.Sangwoo at least always had friends, a loving father for years, was never physically abused nor starved, etc.That falls short to Bum's past who lost his parents, never had friends, was bullied in school, beaten, starved and mentally abused since he's little by his uncle, then regularly raped by his uncle on top of that and that for 2 decades, sexually abused in the army and then Sangwoo putting him through hell.This isn't supposed to be a trauma competition but I can't see why Sangwoo became the hypocritical, narcissistic, abusive Rapist and Serial Killer that he is.There is no reason for his Homophobia.His character is a deep as a puddle.Fictional Serial Killers can be done right, been done multiple times, but most of them were irredeemable.Kira from JJBA, Johan from Monster, etc.They were fucked up and pure evil but it worked so well because they weren't supposed to be sympathized with and yet were such well done characters.When you try to make one sympathize with characters like them, it just doesn't work most of the time.The Author of KS tried that with Sangwoo, but it just didn't click at all for me.The most important point of a non-pure evil villain is to understand where they come from.And that just simply failed here.Y know how I would've done it?Make it similar to the Bastard Manhwa, make Sangwoo's mom a Serial Killer while Sangwoo gets groomed into helping her in the murders so that killing would be nothing new to him when he finally begins to murder people himself.Because unfortunately, that wasn't the case.We were revealed that Sangwoo's father was never abusive to him, we were revealed that Sangwoo always had friends and a girl who has a crush on him, we were revealed that Late Teens Sangwoo already had a well built body (Enough time to work out, enough food to grow), etc.And I'm just like...how?We were supposed to understand that his past was SO horrible that he began abusing, torturing, raping and killing people but how is it that his past is a joke compared to what Bum went through and yet he makes Bum look like a saint?I get that everyone processes trauma differently, but I feel like the Author made his actions way too over the top for me to get where he's coming from.His character is unoriginal, his whole character in S3 besides his abusive behavior is him throwing a pity party, Koogi made him do many heinous things to his victims and Bum, only to pull a retconned backstory out of the ass during S3 and expected to make one sympathize with him, but at that point, the only thing I wanted from Sangwoo was his death.Also, pls stop comparing Atsumu from Haikyuu who is a comfort character to many, to this abusive trash.Food for thought: Bum suffers from BPD and has never gotten any affection during his life which makes him easily attracted to people who show him affection.He's a sensitive individual, making him an Empath.Sangwoo is a Narcissist.Narcissists only care about their own well being, they think that they're superior to everyone.Narcissists are attracted to people they will get the greatest use from.Often, this means they pursue and target empaths.Empaths are „emotional sponges,“ who can absorb feelings from other people very easily.This makes them them very attractive to narcissists, because they see someone who will fulfill their every need in a selfless way.Empaths and narcissists are often drawn to each other because empaths have a lot of compassion and understanding to give, while narcissists thrive on someone worshipping them.Borderlines/Empaths and Narcissists are never a good match, because empaths tend to forgive everything the narcissist does which results in them being completely used and degraded, while the narcissist creates more and more chaos.Empaths are highly empathetic, Narcissists lack empathy.What narcissists see in empaths is a giving, loving person who is going to try and be devoted to you and love you and listen to you.But unfortunately empaths are attracted to narcissists, because at first this is about a false self.Narcissists present a false self, where they can seem charming and intelligent, and even giving, until you don’t do things their way, and then they get cold, withholding and punishing.Narcissists manipulate empaths by stringing them along with intermittent hope.They will integrate compliments and kindness into their behaviour, making their victim believe that if they behave in the correct manner, they will get the loving person back who they once knew.Empathetic people have the tendency to understand that we’re all human, we all have defects, and they’re willing to be patient with someone else’s personal growth.Empathetic people will be very long suffering if a narcissist says "I really want to change, I know I’m not perfect".Narcissists have these moments where they sort of admit fault, but they never actually follow through or believe it.This is simply a tactic narcissists use to reel their partner back in.With empaths, it is very effective, because empaths want to support their partner and help them grow.Ultimately, they are just being exploited by the narcissist further.Ya'll see what I see?Bum is a Textbook Borderline/Empath while Sangwoo is a Textbook Narcissist.Bum is someone with a massive amount of empathy while Sangwoo is someone with none.Bum got attracted to the false Sangwoo who saved him from a rape attempt in the army.Sangwoo abuses and manipulates Bum throughout the story and Bum always forgives Sangwoo and always blames himself.Any time Bum wasn't useful anymore, Sangwoo abandoned and attempted to kill Bum.Sangwoo manipulates Bum at the police station, Bum saves Sangwoo's ass, Sangwoo blames Bum once they got home and beats and rapes him.It's fuckin toxic.Seungbae is the Tritagonist, basically Sangwoo's enemy and the only one who could save Bum from his situation.He goes through some Development over the story, but he had more potential and could've been better used tbh.There were times when I was frustrated with him, but he only means good and is probably the only officer in the story with common sense.I'm glad that he had a happy ending tho.Dude also gets too much hate from the fanbase for no reason.As for Enjoyment, you really don't get anything enjoyable from reading this.Again, very uncomfortable to read, watching Sangwoo beat the shit out of Bum for the hundredth time just made me hate Sangwoo more and more because Bum did nothing to deserve that after what he already went through because of his abusive rapist uncle, his bullies in school and his rapists in the army.Chapter 25/26 made me want to throw up and still does because it was simply that graphic.If this wasn't a story full of abuse, rape and murder, maybe the art style would be enjoyable to see when used on something...less extreme.Since it's a Manhwa, there was no Music ofc, but I remember that the Song Deep Horrors was used for Bum's nightmare chapter (Which was also my favorite chapter by far because of how well it was done and made sense, Bum's brain having suppressed the recent traumatic events which caused the nightmare and the whole chapter was like a acid trip).Then there's also the well known Killing Me Softly With His Song which suits the whole symbolism of the story, with Sangwoo slowly killing Bum over the course of the 3 seasons by abusing and manipulating Bum in every possible way.Over the course, you could say that the reader becomes the victim.Sangwoo abuses Bum from the start.Even during the moments where Sangwoo seems to chill out a little bit, he's still extremely abusive to Bum.Then, towards the end, Sangwoo returns to the person he used to be and nearly kills Bum.The final twist is when we find out Sangwoo had been shouting Bum's name before being killed.At various times over the course of the series we're lead to believe Sangwoo has feelings for Bum.No matter how many times it's made apparent Bum is merely a sexualized stand in for Sangwoo's mother, the reader keeps subconsciously believing it's a genuine attachment.The reader begins to somehow see lower levels of abuse as "love".The mere fact Sangwoo never murders Bum and instead keeps him to torture is "love".Sangwoo's psychological torture is played out in different ways across the series and the final victim is the reader.You believed Sangwoo's lies.You even believed his fake attempts to get better.But that's all it ever really was: lies and fakery.If Bum had showed up before Sangwoo's death, Bum would have merely been blamed by Sangwoo for everything going wrong.There was never any great payoff coming.Sangwoo used Crocodile Tears to manipulate Bum, to gain sympathy from Bum.He was a hypocrite who abused and blamed Bum for getting raped but then asks a bruised up Bum for comfort and readers think that Sangwoo cares for Bum even though he only used him like a emotional tool, it's that fu**ed up.Sangwoo never loved Bum and verbally abused him and the reader fell for Sangwoo's fake kindness, slowly developing Stockholm Syndrome, just like Bum did.Luckily, I never fell for Sangwoo's bullsh*t, so there's that lmao.As for the Genres, again, it ain't a Yaoi that is supposed to be romanticized.There is no love nor romance, it's a abusive relationship and Sangwoo is homophobic, confirmed by the Author to be hetero and doesn't give a damn (Not like the abuse scenes were making that clear enough for the Shippers lmao) about Bum, only using him as replacement.Yoon Bum is bi.I'm myself bi as well, so I have no problems with Yaoi, I do in fact actually adore it (As long as it ain't toxic like here).And as for the other genres?Drama, Horror, Psychological?It just didn't do those things well.The drama feels very forced and unrealistic.There are three seasons and the only reason it went that long is because the police in this manhwa are no smarter than elementary school kids and Seungbae is apparently the only one who can see behind Sangwoo's bullshit.Season 3 felt mostly like filler, it was SO dragged out and boring until the last few chapters.No Drama at all.Horror?It lost that feeling almost completely after Season 1.Psychological?Bum suffers from BPD and I think the Author did a good job at that.But otherwise?Sangwoo has Mother Issues but why did he start kidnapping, abusing, torturing, raping and killing people outta nowhere and that for dozens of years?We know he is self aware and manipulative asf, so he simply did all of those heinous crimes to take his anger out on innocent people?Apparently so cuz we never got a explanation for that.Many other Psychological Thriller Manhwas simply accomplished the psychological aspect way better than KS did."Bastard" for example.Now, the reason why I think the Author clearly romanticized the abusive relationship is because of;1.The special chapters, specifically the Christmas one during S3.Toddler Bum and Infant Sangwoo JUST SO happend to meet back all those years ago?What...?I mean, the special chapters aren't canon so there's that, but this was so cringe and forced, holy sh*t. Especially because the Author said it isn't supposed to be a romance but then did many special chapters which romanticizes a abusive relationship, contradicting herself.Except Bum's nightmare chapter, the special chapters contributed absolute NOTHING to the story.2.The severel amounts of official arts by the Author, one for example is Bum being tied up and having bruises all over his body while Sangwoo is besides him and takes a photo.The Author did several similar ones where Bum is full of bruises, bandaged and even had a broken arm in one while his small, malnourished body is even more exaggerated, and she also retweets the fanarts of her fans which ship a Abuser/Rapist with his victim together, with her going like "💕😍".3.The story doesn’t really do anything to make it seem like a bad thing that Bum was raped, beaten and tortured numerous times by Sangwoo, Sangwoo never pays for what he does to Bum or even got so much as a slap on the wrist, I understand that some of this is because of Sangwoo being a Serial Killer who hasn't been caught yet, but there should’ve been something.It comes off as if the Author doesn't take abuse seriously.Going from one chapter where Bum is being beaten or raped, to another chapter where he isn't being abused for once, doesn't erase what Sangwoo did to him, like the Author potrays it as, nor is it good writing.4.The extreme power dynamic between Sangwoo who's popular, well liked in public and considered attractive, and Bum who gets abused by everyone, never had friends, and is a malnourished loner, with Bum having to do everything Sangwoo says or else he gets beaten, raped, or pays with his life.It's just a huge yikes.5.The way the rape scenes were done.Example: Chapter 25/26, Bum's flashback with his uncle, perfectly shows how inhuman rape is.Bum is traumatized and begins self harming.Chapter 35/36 on the other hand, Sangwoo beats Bum, forces himself on him, Bum doesn't give consent, gets raped, bleeds and screams, but is totally fine the next day.You could argue that it's cuz Bum's Stockholm Syndrome is just that fucked up but the way the rape scene was drawn (Bum blushing while getting raped, big focus on his ass) makes a big difference.The rape scene was drawn in a erotic way.As if the Author romanticizes the rape.Before anybody comes at me saying that I'm just being a hater and how Koogi wrote a Masterpiece, I'd argue that Koogi herself didn't do her researches:Question: "It seems like you are well educated in BPD.Did you do a lot of Research?"Koogi: "No, not really.I just tried to express Yoon Bum's emotions in a not so normal way.It just so happend that those behaviors resembled that of people with BPD."-from Koogi's Q&A.And yet Koogi ended up stating in the beginning of the Manhwa that Bum suffers from BPD?It's as if the Author just followed stereotypes which kinda comes off as disrespectful.Mind you, while I agree that she did do a excellent job with Bum's BPD, the fact that she didn't do any(?)research and just assumed that "not so normal" behaviors resemble those of people with BPD, is kinda offensive tbh.Overall, I basically have a Love Hate Relationship for it.For what it's worth, I actually liked Season 1 for what it was, a Psychological Thriller.When I was younger and read it for the first time when only S1 was out, I enjoyed it.You know why?Because I wanted to see Bum get away from this shit, I wanted someone to save his ass, because it is thrilling to watch something with suspense in it.I did not enjoy the abuse or the rape he went through AT ALL.I did not enjoy the abusive relationship.Nobody should.I enjoyed the suspense around it and I wanted to know if Bum would get away and how.S1 was my favorite season BY FAR due to the Mind Games which is why I guess part of the reason why I'm giving this the lowest rating.It all went downhill in Season 2 imo, S2 was generally already a massive downgrade from the actually well done S1.In Season 1, it felt like every chapter had something to offer.It genuinely fucks with the Readers mind.In Season 2 however, no character developed, we got Bum's backstory, but Sangwoo is still always an asshole to him and Bum is still timid (Although there was one moment where he stood up to the hallucination of his uncle), while the mind games are gone and Sangwoo isn't the scary antagonist anymore, but just a complete Domestic Abuser.Like, S1 wasn't exactly original but at least you were still able to tell that it was a Psychological Thriller, not some "honeymoon phase with my Abuser/Rapist" fanservice crap.Season 3 completely lacked what Season 1 had and can be summed up as a Slice of Life about Sangwoo's Mother Issues+Forced Drama.S3 has 31 chapters, but around 10 chapters are wasted on Sangwoo's past that left more questions than it answered, while the other half is wasted on forced drama+unnecessary rape and sex scenes that do nothing for the plot, while Seungbae barely had screentime.And it's like, what ya'll fail to understand is that Abusers in abusive relationships can also abuse someone mentally in a way to break them even more.In S3, Sangwoo pretended to care about Bum which was only because he was preparing Bum to meet his uncle (Without Bum knowing).Sangwoo, despite knowing how vile Bum's uncle is, brought the uncle to Bum, let him beat Bum up and almost rape Bum again JUST so he can kill the uncle in front of Bum.Sangwoo never gave a damn about how it would affect Bum.He then began physically Bum again, but hey, Sangwoo looks good so him abusing and raping Bum is fine, right?Many things were also left unexplained till the end.Plot points which came up in Season 1 were retconned in later seasons as it never happend.Then there were characters who were forgotten for a majority of the Manwha (Seungbae for example was barely there during the third season).Many Rape Scenes felt like "Sexual Abuse Porn", as seen by Chapter 35, there being no consequences for what Sangwoo did.It also felt like that the Author was contracting herself for what she was actually going for, as some of the Special Chapters felt like Fanservice for the toxic Shippers, trying to put Sangwoo in a different light.And it's not just the author, but the fans as well.Best example is when Bum's grandma is excusing Bum's uncle disturbing abuse on Bum, just because the uncle had a sad past.The author was literally pointing at all the Readers and Shippers, she wanted them to know that a sad past is no excuse for Sangwoo's crimes and abuse on Bum, but they all were either too delusional to catch that, or didn't give a shit.I think the Manhwa had potential, but not only got worse with each season, but also had the wrong fanbase.I know it sounds weird and while I probably will never re-read it, KS feels very nostalgic to me, waiting each week for a new chapter and being pulled into it.I really wish that I could have given it a better rating because it was one hell of a complicated ride, but there were too many things that bothered me over time.The Author probably knew what they were doing and I respect that...but I wish it wasn't labeled as a Yaoi.It causes PRE-TEENS to normalize the abuse Sangwoo lashes out on Bum, saying how "every relationship needs abuse".I feel like the Author started trying to please the toxic fanbase down the line instead of doing her own things anymore.If someone told me that S1 and S3 was written by the same person, I wouldn't believe it.It became just cringeworthy by the time the honeymoon phase was going on."He broke my legs, regularly beats and rapes me but we went skiing so everything's good lol🙂".And idk if it's just me who noticed this, but the chapters where Sangwoo rapes Bum, don't even have a triggering warning.No, because Lezhin is seriously weird about this, Chapter 26 where the uncle rapes Bum has a trigger warning, but Chapter 35 where Sangwoo beats AND rapes Bum (where the rape scene goes on for like half of the chapter), has no trigger warning??And then one chapter in Sangwoo's backstory has a warning for sexual assault, but Chapter 43, where Sangwoo rapes Bum again, has NO warning at all?I don't get it.The toxic fandom only further proves my point, if Bum was female or Sangwoo was ugly then nobody would read this.The recent popularity for the Manhwa "Painter of the Night" is another example, as long as it's two dudes, Fujoshis are fine with romanticizing the abuse and rape that is lashed out on the victim, idk nor do I care whether it is a fetish of the Author and the fans, but Yaois which romanticize such things shouldn't exist in the first place, it is again, disrespectful towards irl victims of physical abuse and rape.Shiet, I like Yaoi but can we stop fetishizing literal abuse, ya'll would see how toxic it is if the victim was female.All in all, it has too many negative things for me to give it a higher rating.When one season is alright, while the other season is boring and lacks character growth, while the last season feels like filler and had a flashback dragged on for several chapters and it ends with a rushed ending, it just can't be considered good at all.The Drama is forced, the pacing is just horrible, the dialogue is cringeworthy and we are stuck with 3 MCs where one is being constantly abused, the other is a absolute asshole while the third one doesn't get as much screentime+all side characters being forgettable.The story is okay at best and unfortunately got worse the longer the story went on.It's unrealistic (as in, having beyond stupid side characters), unoriginal, has unexplained things (How did Bum's parents die, how did Bum have the money to get into college in the first place, how did he escape his uncle, what was wrong with Sangwoo's mom, how is it that the police never catched Sangwoo with the mountain of evidences they had, die Bum die at the end or not, etc), a horrible fandom, a disappointing ending, the list goes on.It did start out okay but it became worse and worse and all the development was thrown away in the end and we received a rushed ending.The Author also used WAY TOO MUCH shock value and many chapters were just unnecessary and felt like filler.Idk, I guess I expected too much??The only reason why I even finished reading it is because I wanted to see how it will end, not because I enjoyed reading it anymore.It ultimately comes off as something that fetishizes abusive relationships behind it being a "psychological thriller".I recommend people to check out "Trauma Bonding" and "The Cycle of Abuse".It's what been going on during the story and romanticizing something that toxic is a big yikes.But for anybody who at least wants to know about Trauma Bonding:Person 1 creates drama over total bullshit and blames Person 2 for Person 1's feelings.Person 2 feels really insecure and apologizes profusely.Person 1 doles out punishment.Person 2 feels as if they deserve it.Person 1 then doles out comfort, reassurance, and maybe even an apology once they decide that enough punishment has happened.Person 2 falls for it every time.Repeat.The one who causes the hurt is also the one who heals.This creates a mad crazy strong bond in both their minds.One of them gets to be in complete control.The other one relives childhood attachment dysfunction which feels so warm and familiar and gets interpreted as love.Love is an action however and these actions are not love.All it is is trauma bonding.And it's close to impossible to get out of.It feels like love, but it's not.Instead it's more like drugs.They make you feel so good in the beginning, and you're hooked.Then, they make you feel so bad, you go through withdrawal and feel desperate to get back to the good feeling, you'll do literally anything to get high.Then they give you the drugs, you feel amazing.And it all crashes again.It just keeps going around and around and around because humans are wired for addiction.This is not love.This is trauma bonding.Love is an action.And their actions are abuse.Person 1, the Abuser in this case, is obviously Sangwoo while Person 2 is Bum.I ultimately wanna say that I despise the message that the Author tried to give at the end.The power dynamic between Bum and Sangwoo was one-sided since the beginning and Sangwoo abused, tortured, manipulated, and raped Bum, while Bum wasn't allowed to defend himself or else he gets abused even more.And yet, as the story goes on, it changes from a scary Psychological Thriller where Bum has to fear for his life, to the Author trying to humanize Sangwoo which completely shatters the image of Sangwoo as the irredeemable monster that he is.The message that the Author made at the end was simply that Sangwoo, a Abuser, Rapist, and Serial Killer, had a hard childhood.Okay...?How are you gonna tell the Readers that the hard childhood of Bum's Uncle doesn't justify the abuse/rape that he lashed out on Bum, but then waste chapters where you try to humanize Sangwoo, who is MUCH worse than Bum's Uncle?Not only does that leave the impression that you're supposed to sympathize with Abusers as long as they're not ugly, but it also leaves the message that Abusers are victims, that you need to understand them, that you need to heal them, and that deep down, they love their victims who they abused/raped.That is pure bs.Victims don't have to empathise or try to heal their Abusers.Sangwoo and Bum's Uncle were both Abusers and Rapists who gave Bum pure hell, they don't deserve even a single ounce of sympathy.The comic portrayed a physically, sexually and emotionally abusive "relationship".From the beatings, to the torture, to the manipulation, to the rape, to the murder attempts, Bum went through dozens of traumatic experiences during it due to Sangwoo and his previous trauma due to his uncle was reopened by Sangwoo when he was forced to tell him about it, only to get blamed for what the uncle did to him.Whenever Sangwoo showed vulnerability, it was never about Bum, but about himself, and he used Bum as a emotional tool, a vessel to take his frustration out on.That's it.The first chapter shows how Bum almost got gangraped by his superiors during his military service, so I don't get how someone came to the idea to romanticize such a story.It's a shame that this got overrun by people who romanticize and joke about about abuse&rape.James Somerton made a really good video on this so I recommend checking it out.Stop romanticizing abusive relationships and instead try to help those who are being abused irl.Thank you.Reviewer’s Rating: 1What did you think of this review?Nice              0              Love it              0              Funny              0              Confusing              0

JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 7: Steel Ball Run(Manga)add        (All reviews)      Jan 1, 2013TomahRecommended                 In Steel Ball Run, Araki once again delivers a story arc full of clever battles, creative abilities, crazy plots and lovely characters.No, this is even better than the previous arcs, as the author continues to recycle his own style and improve without limits.This is a very rare example in which the author actually gets better with time, and Steel Ball Run provides very good evidence for that.The story starts out pretty simple: our crippled Joestar hero, Johny, gangs up with Gyro Zeppeli and aims for the top in the intense Steel Ball Run race.Each competitor has his own unique motivations, abilities and                  ...means to win.Add the wackiness of the Stands to the mix and you've got yourself one hell of a ride, much like previous installments of the saga.But Steel Ball Run goes one step beyond and throws in characters/factions with their own agendas, a large conspiracy and personal quests.That doesn't mean the story is complicated, but it definitely has interesting plot twists, intense conflicts and engaging character dynamics.Everything just flows so well that it's easy to get sucked in by the manga.The art gets even more refined, making brilliant use of Araki's trademark style to highlight emotions, grant impact to a scene or simply serve as true feasts to the reader's eyes, specially with the rich character designs.Gyro and Johny are likely the best JoJo protagonists to date, despite not topping Joseph from Part 2 in terms of badassery.They are far from perfect, but that's what makes them fascinating: they keep struggling with their inner demons, which are also their greatest enemies, in order to continue advancing, revealing more and more aspects of their personalities in the process.Their bond of friendship is quite powerful and authentic; even meaningless interactions are a lot of fun to watch.Oh, and Gyro's charisma is a huge plus.The rest of the cast may not be as developed as Johny and Gyro, but they still shine.For starters, you've got Dio, who is again that bastard we all love to hate, manipulating everyone he can to achieve his personal goals.There is also the sympathetic cowboy Mountain Tim, the conflicted Hot Pants, the hilarious comedy relief Pocoloco and many other remarkable characters.The main antagonist is also great, using all of his experience acquired in combat, political power and honest, strong patriotism to pose a serious threat for the heroes.As usual, battles are one of the biggest focus of the narrative and the main driving force behind the characters' growth, by putting them against desperate situations which demand a strong resolve and difficult choices to be made.While the Stands were becoming stronger and stronger in the previous arcs, Steel Ball Run brings most of them down dramatically.There are few overpowered abilities, making the battles very strategical and a lot demanding of the users.This is highlighted in battles such as the one against Axl Ro, which literally makes everyone involved face their sins, specially Johny and Hot Pants.If you're up for some exciting, yet intelligent battles, a great cast of characters and one of the most bizarre races of the entire universe, then JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Steel Ball Run is for you.And it doesn't matter whether you are an experienced reader of the JoJo saga or a total newcomer, because the Steel Ball Run excludes no one!(Reviewed for the club "Reviews for the unreviewed")

JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 7: Steel Ball Run(Manga)add        (All reviews)      Jun 1, 2020geovannybossRecommended                 Mild spoilers!it is difficult to talk about the story or characters without saying something..."What is so hype about Steel Ball Run?"It is a question that people who do not read often wonder the answer.The part basically gets rid of stands and focuses on stand abilities, so its more the user if fighting than the actual stand.Guns are actually a threat for the first time in the series in a while, and stands are so much weaker that Gyro doesn't even have a stand throughout the part.The fight against the main villain is also very well done, with both sides having interesting                  ...abilities.Gyro and Johnny's friendship is also very well done and both are likeable characters.Andd "Why is Steel Ball Run so good?"It's one of the most maturely written JoJo story in the entire saga.It's pretty dark, featuring what can be considered the least good JoJo in a moral stance.Unlike previous parts where it's either saving the world or stopping Dio and his minions, Johnny's motivation throughout the story mostly selfish.Some fans might argue that Valentine is more justified in his actions as the antagonist than Johnny is as the main protagonist.Besides that, the setting really takes advantage the fact that its a race that spans all of the USA in the 19th century.You have various locales and a unique variation of enemies Johnny and Gyro face off against that came all over the world to participate in the Steel Ball Run.I could go on like how Valentine is written as a very likeable villain, how Diego is more than the "i'm evil because i can" guy his original incarnation was, how unique the story behind the stands and the spin are, and all other stuff.The most important thing is that Araki done a very terrific job rebooting the JoJo universe with SBR.If anything, Part 7 is his magnum opus.Yep, that's it.I've finished reading the adored and said best part of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure...What a journey !I enjoyed every bit of it, from the story (the idea of a horse race through the late 1800s America and the twist of Jesus's corpse being the real objective), characters ( I particularly appreciated Hot Pants and her chemistry with Johnny, but also Sandman who is the absolute madlad, or even minor stand users such as Mr. Blackmore or Ringo) to the entertaining stand fights and the beautiful landscapes shown throughout the race.I must say I really enjoyed the character of Lucy, a kind of "part 7 Hayato", who endured numerous traumatic experiences, but without giving up.Furthermore, her relationship with her husband was really moving and cute to my mind.Then Valentine, the perfect villain : behind an evil and selfish goal hides in fact a strong feeling of patriotism, that couldn't nevertheless overcome the thirst for power and control.D4C was a reaaaally op Stand that was absolutely wonderfully used to create entertaining fights with the protagonists.And finally, oh boy, oh Gyro, such a deep character.He showed us lots of aspects that a JoJo character was expected to embody (a difficult yet moving background, courage, wit, a noble objective, humour, sometimes sadness, and so on.But that was a lot deeper than that, and Gyro was the perfect match for Johnny.Their relationship just works so well it becomes unreal.Two strangers, different nationalities, different backgrounds yet they are perfectly fit for each other.I fricking loved the jokes/songs moment where Gyro put his whole heart only to be in front of a cold yet amused Johnny, even sometimes adding more to the ridiculous situation.Johnny was an interesting JoJo to follow.He started the adventure for himself, continued for himself too but couldn't hold back his feelings to intervene when dealing with other characters like Hot Pants or Sandman.Above all, his sincere friendship with Gyro is what made him strong enough to go on on his journey for the corpse's parts.The protagonist is complexThe main allies are interestingThe villain is believableEven the throwaway villains are fascinating, especially Ringo RoadagainThe artwork is exceptional (as per usual)The Stand battles are brilliantly choreographedAnd Pulp Fiction reference...!Yep, like everyone who reads, we can agree to say it was a bizarre yet amazing adventure!A Cripple who likes balls, an Italian executioner, a cross dressing nun, and a Dinosaur man race across America, finding Jesus' Corpse Parts, and fighting the president with neat hair.Thanks Araki.Reviewer’s Rating: 10What did you think of this review?Nice              0              Love it              0              Funny              0              Confusing              0

Nisekoi(Manga)add        (All reviews)      Apr 16, 2014TotalPlebianMixed Feelings                 Before I say anything else, I should clarify that a 6/10 score doesn't mean this manga isn't worth reading.6/10 is "fair" and that is exactly what this manga is at this point.Secondly, I feel like I really have to give two scores for Nisekoi:For the first 45-50 chapters:Genuine plot progression and character development, decent romance, and the feeling that the story was building upon itself.This part of Nisekoi is highly enjoyable and is the section currently being covered by anime Shaft is producing.It's a rom-com at its finest and gets a solid 8/10.The problem starts after that....unless you like 60(sorry, did                  ...I say 60?I meant 160) chapters of filler.Gone is the character development, gone is the hilarious approach to love, in is an ever-growing harem of girls we know won't win and the abuse of gags.What starts as a truly entertaining love triangle blossoms into a nauseating dodecahedron with all the depth of a bath tub.It's like the manga is an airplane that has stalled and is now plummeting downwards, getting closer to a wreck by the week.With the latest girl added to the harem: the onee-san ninja chinese gangster who Raku happens to know, it is obvious the author is suffering from PSOOYA disease, a terrible conditions many writers suffer from.That is, "Pulling Shit Out Of Your Ass" My current score for chapters 55-current(118) is about 4/10, and that's being generous to say the least.To understand why Nisekoi's plot goes off the rails and is replaced by bland moe-blobbery on a weekly basis, you have to understand two things.First; this is a manga that is published in Shonen jump, where long serialization is more important than development.Second: the demographic reading it doesn't give a shit.The popular vote for favorite character is very telling to the kind of people reading this in Japan, but I'll get to that later.Story: 5/10Starts off with an unoriginal but fun premise and is, for the first part at least, very well done.It would have a higher score if it had progressed an inch in 60 chapters.Art: 8/10While the art in Nisekoi can vary slightly, it always seems to get its point across perfectly.As much as I hate what has been drawn recently(moe,moe,moe!)it always does a very good job at representing characters and their emotions.No complaints here.Characters: 5/10"Five out of ten in a series based off its characters!Sacrilege!"is probably what the die hard fanboys are thinking right now, but with no development whatsoever in any character apart from Chitoge that is what they deserve.For starters, let's look at the MC.Raku: Typical dense MC.Is at his most interesting/least cliche when dealing with Chitoge, but becomes a flat character when dealing with just about any other girl.Has a case of convenient amnesia.Chitoge: First girl bias, incoming.A lot of people brand her as the "typical tsundere/bipolar" but her being cold to Raku initially shouldn't be surprising considering the premise.She hates Raku at the beginning but is forced to act all lovey-dovey when others are around, so of course she comes across as bipolar: that's the "joke".She's the only girl with some proper backstory and that has some level of depth to her character, but that's largely because she's the only one that went through non-contrived development.Onodera: Fan-boys are going to flame the crap out of me for this, but she is your run of the mill cutesy girl character.A lot of people prop her up as "pure" but the truth is she's annoyingly indecisive and mind-numbingly boring.If you have a hard-on for shy girls and have never been in any sort of relationship in your life she's going to be your favorite character because that is her entire appeal.Surprise surprise, she's the most popular character in Japan.Ruri: Best female character?Maybe.It seems side-characters are the only ones with heads on their shoulders in this series and in Ruri's case this is extremely apparent.Shuu: Best male character?Definitely.He isn't dense and he's generally extremely fun to watch.The rest of the harem: You'll fall in love with Marika if you stalkers who hold onto a love from when they were five years old and are ready to rip couples apart to get it back."She deserves Raku the most"  is a bit half-arsed when she doesn't know jack-shit about the current Raku and none of us know anything about her apart from the fact that she's pretty, talks like a redneck, and wants to marry Raku.She'd be a lot more likable if she'd been introduced slowly.Tsugumi plays her role well but her character development was contrived as it gets "he called me cute, character 180 time!".I'm not even going to get into the others, because we don't know enough about Chinese-teacher-don-nee-chan yet and I don't even want to get started on the little sister.The 'fake love' between Chitoge and Raku is really the highlight of this manga.Enjoyment: 6/10For the same reasons as I put on "story", 8/10 for the first half and 6/10 for the second half, respectively.Overall: 6/10If within the next 20-30 chapters there is a sign that this manga is once more moving towards an ending it will go back up to a 7-8.At this point in time I don't recommend reading it because I'm not sure how the authors going to do it, but I can guarantee to you if you hear that Nisekoi got a "harem end" it's NOT worth the read.EDIT:After literally years it has ended.Years of filler.Honestly, give this thing a shot for the first few chapters and if you don't like the characters a LOT by the 50s or 60s, drop it.Not worth it otherwise.Ending was ok at least.Reviewer’s Rating: 6What did you think of this review?Nice              0

RecommendedPreliminary                                                      (389/390 chp)                                                   Before beginning this review, I will like to point out that the intention of this review is not to trigger Hunter X Hunter (HxH for short)fans or let them feel like I'm attacking them or their intelligence since that is basically the trend in most reviews these days.Most reviews are made with the intention to 'trigger' a reaction out of fans by criticizing a series to the point that you are telling fans that they are basically dumb for liking a particular series.This review is simply showing you guys another perspective since HxH fans aren't used to seeing much criticism when it comes to                  ...this series.Now, shall we begin?Hxh is a series that I once loved, the anime that is, now after finishing the anime I went into the manga and quickly realise a problem this series has had in the anime, but now, it was more apparent in the manga.The problem is the absurd amount of dialogue and monologue within it that makes it ridiculous, the author of HxH decided that every single character is going to have long monologue and dialogue, but it's even worse when the characters are just redshirts.The latest arc is especially guilty of this, basically, we as the reader are forced to see the point of view of literally every single character in this arc; the guards of the Prince's, the Prince's, guards of a Prince stalking another Prince, people associated to a Prince, people keeping an eye on another Prince, the Mafia Bosses, Hunters, the guards of the Mafia Bosses, the people from branch families, all of the underlings of the people from branch families as well, and we can go on and on — I wouldn't be surprised if we start getting the point of view from the trees, cats, dogs and basically everything else.You get the point.This is not interesting at all and it's just a chore to read.Sure you can say that he is amazing for giving redshirts their moments and making them feel important, but, truth be told, redshirts will always be redshirts!You can give them a few dialogues or give them a purpose later on without watering down the series quality by having them talk about stuff, we as the readers, are already aware of.I also saw the Viz translation, and it's a bit better, but still, its too dialogue heavy and unnecessary — just pointing that out before someone says it is Mangastream's fault, btw this is wall x text the manga.Togashi is like a student that is writing an essay that should be 800 words in length and thinks that writing a 2000 word essay instead will impress the teacher.That is basically how a lot of the fans are behaving as well, I've seen HxH fans praising the series because it has so many dialogues and saying how long it took them to read a single chapter, like it was some type of accomplishment, while other HxH fans are saying they feel dumb because they are not understanding the plot.The truth is, the reason why some people are having difficulty in understanding the plot is because Togashi, as a writer, is failing to express his work to his readers properly, because all he is doing is throwing dialogue and monologue at his fans and telling them that they should figure out his mess, I'm not sure how the editor even approve these chapters.If this was a monthly manga then that could be an excuse to why some fans are forgetting vital points, but it's a weekly series which means it should be easier to follow and remember.Togashi is also lacking in the "show but not tell" type of storytelling, he would rather lazily tell the audience every tiny detail, even the irrelevant ones.I'm sure Togashi has planned out everything in this arc and that he knows what he is doing, but he is not executing it properly if half of his fans feel like it is a chore to read his manga, it just means he is not writing this arc in a creative way.At the end of the day, its the author's story, but he is writing his story to his fans, and if his fans are not liking it, something is clearly wrong.Togashi may have a brilliant idea, but if he is not executing it properly then it is all a waste.This manga overall is a chore to read and it is boring for me personally, the characters for HxH has always been decent for me, I never had a problem with the characters, I don't think they are anything special but at the same time, I don't think they are bad.I don't like the art style because it is drawn in a generic style that I, personally don't like, but its even worst when it is not drawn properly by Togashi.In saying that, the art really doesn't affect my enjoyment that much, since there isn't much art, to begin with.Overall, this manga is a 4/10, and I don't feel like Togashi is taking advantage of his imagination.I know he can do way better than this, and perhaps this series will be a bit more bearable to watch when it's animated, whenever that is.To people that are still enjoying this series, more power to you, but at least try to understand why some peoples are not enjoying it, without talking down on them or challenging their intelligence, because I've seen that a lot.As a university student, reading HxH feels like reading a school textbook, the only purpose is for you to temporarily memorize information just to pass a test.HxH is at the borderline of a school textbook than a fictional book, which basically sums up how I currently feel for this series, and I'm having a lot of doubt that my opinion will ever change.Thanks for reading if you were able to reach this far.Reviewer’s Rating: 4What did you think of this review?Nice              0              Love it              0              Funny

a positive way.It never tried to do anything that was never done before as the author since the beginning had in plan what the series would have become.The truth is, for whatever reason, the easy stuff that should have gotten right was done the opposite and the author never learned from her mistakes to make the story more consistent later on instead she went out of her way to worse things up.Kimetsu no Yaiba suffers from mainly 3 things:1 - It's writing2 - Its comedy3 - Its villains1 - I hate it to say this                  ...but the writing is bad.It all consists of turning a character into a human since somehow she had become a demon and Tanjiro, her brother has to take a lot of pain to achieve this goal.By pain I mainly mean doing unbelievable stunts, getting hurt without consequences (well, directly to him since there are characters that die while saving him), and having insane luck.Of course, all this happens because of the way it's written.The author has managed to make the protagonist untouchable by literally anything.It doesn't matter what happens, he and her sister will survive.From chapter one when Tanjiro encounters Giyuu and the latter is about to kill Nezuko.Tanjiro saved her because he impressed one of the strongest characters in the series.A guy that has been killing demons left and right is impressed by a cheap trick is what the author is making us believe as if this has never happened to him Before.To the last moment of fighting which Tanjiro has still the power of God within him.In the early chapters, we get introduced to two more characters that appear out of nowhere and help Tanjiro on becoming stronger.We never got any explanation why that's the case and how that's possible because slightly after Tanjiro finished his training we learn from Urokodaki that the two are actually dead and they were once his students.How's that possible they were able to interact with Tanjiro?Are they ghosts?Is that even a thing in the Kimetsu no Yaiba universe?Because the author NEVER mentioned that phenomenon anymore.At worst this is a crazy asspull we've got to witness.Clearly, the author didn't know how to make Tanjiro stronger that would make a lick of sense and she just went on the stinky territory.Since this is a shonen, it's imperative for everyone to help Tanjiro because the odds are that Tanjiro and Nezuko are the only ones that could actually defeat Muzan.Throughout the story, many individuals help him because they see the courage held within his spirit and the so-called desire to help his sister.They're moved by their sad story and of course, they risk their lives for two random kids they just met.On the other hand, the fights are extremely dull.They seem flashy but none use any strategic means to beat them.They go full-on-power and directly attack the enemy without causing them any damage.As for the development characters get, is not much.In fact, the one important character that has the most development happens to have less screentime.It is weird and I was really hoping for other characters to have the same growth as well which sadly didn't happen.2 - The comedy at first didn't even exist.Not until Zenitsu and Inosuke were introduced.The two are the classic yelling guys that so happen to accompany the protagonist on his quests to save his sister.The reasons for this simple fact are to this day yet unknown but they do and so we get to witness all sorts of 'jokes' that not only aren't funny and would make anyone die inside but they're placed in such a nuisance that affects their battles as well.Zenitsu yelling for a half episode but for some reason when sleeping he gains some OP power which naturally makes us question why didn't he do that earlier?Did we really need to hear him yell like a maniac?The same goes for Inosuke.He doesn't need to sleep but regardless in a lot of cases he still gets OP for really no reason accompanied by the lovely 'comedy' that is yelling.Yes, the comedy in this series is yelling.That's it!Are you on the floor laughing right now?Laugh goddammit!Laugh!AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA - Zenitsu and Inosuke in a nutshell.3 - They're simply bland.Whether they had an over-the-top personality or a calm one, they're extremely poorly written because they gain nothing and get effortlessly beaten.A villain gets introduced, monologues for like a chapter, beats the crap of the good guys but somehow gets cornered and dies because the good guys had a stronger will and didn't surrender.No strategies are involved, just swords slash, a few random powers usually bestowed upon the protagonist and a friendship speech just to cool off the whole thing and the villain is done for.What's worse is its flashback's purpose that exists only to show one's forgiveness rather than showing its motivations.Well then, let me ask you this, why do they repent themselves on the verge of death?Is that a requirement?Because, as far we have seen no one has actually done so in their full power.What the author is trying to get us to understand is that everyone deep down inside has a good soul and deserves a second chance but this is NOT the way to go about it.If nothing else you can have one or two characters that are inherently good and have them change but it shouldn't work for anyone.Not everyone has to be a good guy just because the protagonist is the classic 'gentle guy' that wants to save everyone for literally no reason.Furthermore, the rest of the characters aren't great either.Aside from the main cast, which is the worst in the series, everyone else, despite all having a different and cool personality, are bad.Not by default though.Some of them have a cool 'sense of justice' but are badly developed and it saddens me.A few die too quickly that get little to no development and some others take an awfully long time to either win or die and in the midst of that, even though they do receive a somewhat interesting flashback that would define their objective at best, is placed either too soon or too late.Never in the right spot that would not distract them from the battle itself in receiving a random and unnecessary bust of their powers.As for the ending, is really bad.Because not only Muzan death was anticlimactic but the whole reincarnation thingie was not necessary to the story itself.You could have added a few more chapters and added a time-skip that would have solidified the case at best but alas it didn't happen.Last but not least, art.It's not bad.It's definitely somewhat original although not very detailed and at times sloppy.It's well-drawn when it is but it's unnecessary awful in other cases.It's rushed.You can see the author just didn't have enough time to work more with it and left everything like that.Though, it's her first work therefore she's forgiven.All in all, Kimetsu no Yaiba is overrated.There are some likable characters here and there but that's about it.It didn't do any good for me and I hope this review will share the truth among all the lies that have been spread since its anime adaptation.Reviewer’s Rating: 4What did you think of this review?Nice

review, and went from the score of 1 to 10.I've actually reread the entire manga in a single night, and came to a different conclusion.This review is 100% spoilers and an attempt at explaining the divisive ending, so don't read it if you're just starting.If it helps, know that I've spent 11 years reading it, and reread it many times so I could form this opinion, meaning that my rating holds weight, and you won't be making a mistake if you choose to read this manga.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------While I do understand the anger of the                  ...fandom, there's one really big problem with the arguments you guys put out.It seems that literally none of you understand who and what Eren Yeager is.Now, I'll be honest with you.I was also an "Erenchad", I also rooted for genocide.139 hit me like a truck, I was pissed for hours.Why would he end it like this?He effectively backtracks on all his beliefs.A complete 180.Then I calmed down, and started thinking.Did Isayama mess up the ending, or did I not understand Eren at all?Let's start at the beginning.Eren Yeager was born as the most unfortunate piece of shit on the planet.There's a reason he says "I'm not really sure why I did it".Look at his baby eyes in 139.The moment Ymir made contact with that parasite, Eren Yeager was destined for doom.It's quite silly when you think about it - the man who represented freedom - was the one farthest away from it.Him saving Mikasa in the cabin, getting her to follow him, and everything after it - wasn't Erens doing.The poor guy was acting on reflexes of a long dead demigod, who needed Mikasa for some reason to be free.Now we come to 2 Erens that make this story - pre future memories, and post future memories Eren.Pre future, as you can probably guess, is Eren before getting his memories when he kissed Historias hand.Ymirs grasp over him wasn't that strong at the time.However, contact with royal blood allowed Ymir to wake up inside him.At that precise moment, Eren Yeager died, and was no more.He was nothing more than a complete vessel for Ymir.And that perfectly explains every action of his from now on then.Imagine if you knew you were going to die in 4 years, while killing 80% of the population.You also find out that it was YOU who killed your own mother.Erens entire persona was based on avenging his mom.IMAGINE what all those revelations do to the psyche of a then 15 - now 19 year old boy.A kid.1) You are solely responsible for the deaths of your closest friends2) You killed your own father and mother3) You will force your own friends to kill you later on4) No matter what happens, you leave the world blind, and you won't know if Eldians will actually survive>Hur dur explain his sudden love for MikasaWell, it was always there.Back then, the world was surrounded with human eating monsters, his mother has died, and he just found out he's one of the monsters - do you think he can afford a relationship with Mikasa?He swept all his personal feelings under the carpet.Despite not showing it well, he was extremely glad he had Armin and Mikasa in his life.You could also make an argument that his love and attachment to Mikasa was all Ymirs doing - we will never know.You simply have to understand Eren Yeager after he got future memories.He died, then and there.What took over was a persona that knew of his doom, and the suffering he would cause to everyone around him, the fact he killed his own mother, as well.And on top of that, he had to play pretend as a sinister lunatic, force Yeagerists into a plan that will kill them all, for essentially nothing, break his bonds with Mikasa and Armin - and this is especially important, as the last 2 people on the planet that trusted him back then - were those 2.He knew there was no way out.He had to go to Liberio and kill innocent people.A big hint of all of this is his talk with Ramzi - that turkish boy.That's where real Eren peeked out for a second.Literally, what's the point in saving the kid?I'm forced into killing him later, anyway.For a resolution I'm not sure of.To "free" a creature I know nothing of.Eren Yeager, who represented freedom, knew he was the biggest slave in all of existence - from the moment he was born.A slave to some primordial power he did not understand.What can one 19 year old kid do against such odds?He can only break down, and suffer, as he did, until the end.Eren Yeager isn't "based", "genocidal" or "evil", he's an extremely tragic character that wanted one thing he could never have - freedom.Reviewer’s Rating: 10What did you think of this review?Nice              0              Love it              0              Funny              0              Confusing              0

right here right now".And he did.When I was in middle school a cute girl I really liked went out with the most athletic rugby player who then smugly told me that she moans like a siren in bed.Pshh, asshole.In my college years I consistently woke up to the sounds of my room mate screaming "harder harder!".Sigh.Finally, in my twenties I realised that all those people were gone from my life and despite all they've unwittingly done to                  ...my psyche I started to feel rather lonely.That's 'Oyasumi Punpun' in a tangential nutshell.But enough of my sentimental autobiography, let's cut to the chase.The story follows Onodera Punpun and focuses on the struggles his mind experiences to comprehend exactly how humanity operates as he grows up from being a kid.I like the fact that this manga portrays life in its crudest form.We all remember the shit we've done as we grew up and we all have a few skeletons in our closet.Well think of 'Oyasumi Punpun' as a massive skeleton party.Drinks all around!The cast is full of... people.Alcoholics, violent maniacs, horny sluts, smug loners, idiots, nutcases.And they all interact with each other.Why, you could mistake this work for being the 'local news' section of your town's newspaper.Friendships are formed and broken, relationships consummated and older bearded men run around the streets with their cocks out.And all you do as reader, is watch that world through the eyes of someone who doesn't understand it but is desperately trying to.The artwork here is absolutely magnificent.I marvelled at Asano's (mangaka) skill at being able to adapt his style to fit the mood every single time.And while on that topic, the style coupled with the story will mostly make you feel depressed and surely reminisce of your younger years.So yes, the artwork is top notch.Every character also feels alive and vibrant, not only because of detail but because the artwork so conspicuously presents their emotions.You probably won't enjoy this manga; that doesn't mean it's bad.Who the fuck likes waking up in the morning?But apparently it's good for you.Same here.'Oyasumi Punpun' is an unbiased whole picture of life.We have but a single mind so our views are naturally biased and rational in nature to keep us sane and optimistic.Asano gives you the mind and experiences of every character in this manga, so everything appears without bias... factual... cold... depressing.And then we begin to see that sometimes life can be a lot more cruel than we thought.One hell of ride this has been.Went so far down the memory lane I forgot where my home was.But don't we all have those moments sometimes?10 points.A masterpiece.Reviewer’s Rating: 10What did you think of this review?Nice              0              Love it

Warning]Let me begin by mentioning that I enjoy pessimistic works with nihilistic elements.So given the hype of this manga, I had high expectations.Needless to say, I was disappointed.I would have dropped it before its first quarter was completed, but its extreme high ratings, on both websites I follow, left me with a drifting promise of a hidden depth, or at least of an extraordinary ending.The work was shallow and the ending was horrible, so all that's left for me to do, is to write this review and  warn anyone who will listen.This manga has only one good point; it                  ...has a great technical structure.What I mean with that, is that the artwork, the panels, and the direction are great.Unfortunately, the technical competency of the mangaka is wasted.It even begins with promise; managing to conjure up some locked-up nightmares from primary school.But then it's a free-fall.The time-jumps undermine the importance the prior events.The side characters eat a good chunk of space without being interesting, and -what's more important- never contributing anything.The uncle, the father, the two classmates, the overplayed cult; they offered nothing, but asked to be paid handsomely in panels.We continue.The forcefulness of some events make the manga look silly, for instance the way Punpun lost his virginity, or the uncle's “tragic” back-story.And then it's the pretentiousness, a strong blossoming pretentiousness that manifests twofold: All these attempts to make the story a little darker, puny attempts to insert some sick or hardcore elements, and of course all those dialogs that tried so hard to appear philosophical and deep.Last but not least, it's the ending; I expected fireworks, but a fart is all I got.The way I see it, the mangaka was a coward; he could have gone with an inspiring happy ending, or a dark one that could leave a scar.But instead, it is like he was afraid to be mainstream with the happy ending, but also he did not want to descent underground into the darkness.And that undecisiveness lead a complete failure of an ending.I could go on, but I think my point is clear.It is also clear that my opinion regarding this manga makes me a minority, but please take note that I rarely rate so low any work, regardless of medium.So: 2.0/10.Reviewer’s Rating: 2What did you think of this review?Nice              0              Love it

                                            (99/147 chp)                                                   Oyasumi Punpun is one of the greatest coming of age stories told in any form of media.This story is a very relative tale of alienated youth riddled with heavy accuracy.The story is very well developed and is partially due to its long timeline spanning from Punpun's life in elementary school to his early 20's.It deals with many mature issues like sex and depression all told in a frank manner that is coated with a strange dark sense of humor and supreme melancholy.There is a lot going on including a couple of side stories involving people that are or were once in                  ...Punpun's life, like his uncle and his old classmates.There is also a side story about a strange cult that has been foreshadowed in the very first volumes and is slowing becoming bigger and more important to the story.Inio Asano's storytelling talent is probably best showcased in this series.He manages to keep the story strikingly relatable while throwing wacky surrealism in and weaving together one huge moving piece with many plots and characters.The art is absolutely gorgeous.The speechless panels of messy rooms and hopeless youth crying in bed has never looked so glamorous.The obvious and most interesting aspect of the art in this manga is how the main character and his family are drawn.The idea of Punpun and his family being depicted as a poorly drawn cartoon birds is absolutely genius!You have to understand that these people aren't really cartoons walking around in an oblivious world but are physical manifestations of how Punpun feels about himself and his family.You really get a sense of how important that theme is in later volumes where his appearance starts to shift and understanding why that is.The characters in this manga are really great.Asano is very good at creating solid characters, and again with the timeline, they have ample time to develop smoothly.The only thing negative I would say about the characters is that they are extreme and there is no effort in making them "likeable" because they are too busy proving how genuine they are with their actions and words.So you either you love them or hate them, It might irritate some people who don't like when characters are a little too pitiful or preachy, like people who don't like The Catcher in the Rye because Holden Caulfield "just whined the whole time."This story can really throw you through a loop.It's very long and twisting and silly and serious at the same time so it's a not a "light read" by any means.the word enjoyment is a little off but I would definitely say this manga affected me.There are times where you will laugh and times you will feel really depressed.But all in all It's very smart, real, and stylish so if you can handle depressing stories it's well worth it.Reviewer’s Rating: 10What did you think of this review?Nice              0              Love it

Bleach was one of the first subbed anime that I picked up.I eventually started reading the manga and I really enjoyed it.However, after the end of the arc where Ichigo manages to save Rukia, everything went downhill from there.The story was very good up to the end of the Soul Society arc as it was always very suspenseful and the fights were well-contrived.However, after that arc was done, you have a plethora of new characters and new plot devices stuffed down your throat and you are never                  ...quite given the opportunity to find out about anyone's backstory except for a few of the main characters.You eventually end up reading a manga where the sole focus is on Ichigo and how he gains power-ups in order to save the damsel-in-distress.In the Hueco Mundo arc of the series, everyone is turned into a fraction of what they were in the Soul Society arc, especially Renji.You can't help but feel mad that characters such as Renji and Chad are virtually useless.The story follows a very sequential and contrived plot where if there are a number of fights, the fights are shown one by one and after the 5th or 6th fight in a row you just want to stop reading.While the manga art is good at times, in most fight scenes you end up with frames that you don't even know what's going on in the frame; it just looks like one big blotch of ink.It isn't just one or two frames per fight that uses this technique, there are half a dozen or more frames within a fight where the frames don't give any detail at all; they just give you the illusion that the characters involved are moving very fast.Not only that, but Tite Kubo can also use up a whole page to draw one frame, or a whole page to draw three or less meaningless frames that don't move the plot forward at all.He also uses wide margins so that his frames use up less ink.This isn't good art, and this isn't a good manga and you can very much tell that Tite Kubo is bored with his creation.The series is dying and it doesn't look like it'll be revived anytime soon.It's a one-way trip to Heuco Mundo for this once-decent manga.Reviewer’s Rating: 3What did you think of this review?Nice              0

on Titan.This series before the anime wasn't popular in the west, but it was fairly popular in Japan being in the top 15/10 best selling manga in 2011/2012.After the airing of the anime it became a mega hit series.Now before you give this review a not helpful vote because of the 10/10 score.At least read what I have to say before doing your deed.I'm more interested that you guys read my review than anything else.Now let's begin!"Spoiler free review!"Story: 10/10.The plot/story IMO is snk strongest point."Titans" these monstrous looking creatures that                  ...comes in different shapes and size.Their main and only goal is to eat "humans" 100 years ago humans where forced to live Inside the walls which are over 50 meters tall, to stop the titans from getting in.This series is full of mysteries for eg.who or what created the walls?Are titans natural creatures?Who created titan shifters?Why were they created?This is just a small dose of the amount of mysteries in snk.Snk is a mystery series with horror elements in it.The plot/story is snk strongest point, but it can be a disadvantage to the series itself.Why?Because the story is setup in a way where it doesn't spoon feed you answers right away, and if the readers don't pay attention to the story.They will forget things that were earlier "foreshadowed" also the series being a monthly manga doesn't help.A lot of complaint I've heard about the series is that it feels like the author is making up things as it goes or pulling things out of his ass.Now this isn't the case.Snk is one of those series that gets better when you reread it.When you reread the series you will see the amount of foreshadowing/hints the author puts in the early chapters of the series.Things that has been foreshadowed in the very first volume is now being answered currently in the latest chapters of the manga.What does this tells you?It tells you that the author has planned out everything already, and he already knows how the story will conclude.The world building in snk is impressive!The amount of details the author puts in his world building is just great.Thd mysteries of the series and the overall plot is just so engaging.You just want to know the answers.This is one of the reasons snk has a lot of theory threads around the net.You know the TV series called "lost" that's the vibes I get from snk story.Except snk will answer our question and not give us any bullshit....I'm not going to go there.Anyways read over this series at least once.You will have a better understanding of the overall plot.And you will be less likely to ask stupid questions.Sadly not everyone is willing or have the time to read over the series.Sigh.Art: 8/10.You guys must be saying in your mind."what!?O.O 8/10 for snk art?fanboy alert!"lol, let me explain why I gave it a 8/10.At first I didn't like the art.But I slowly started to like the art.The main reason is because the roughness in the art fits the horror theme very well In this series, I don't think the series would successfully have the "horror" feel to it if it had something like, the Levi spin off manga.I do have to say I don't think the art is as bad as people are making it out to be.I think the scan is mostly at fault for this, if you buy the actual volume you will notice it looks much better than the online scans.Compare crunchy roll scans with manga panda and mangastream scans you will see a difference in quality.Characters: 8/10.A lot of people say snk characters are flat/one dimensional.You will also notice that most of the peeps that said it are anime only viewers.Now, the first 30+ chapters which is basically the 1st season of the anime are mostly use to introduce us to the big cast of characters.The author flesh out the 3 main characters which are Eren, Mikasa and Armin.The secondary characters are not shown too often so obviously the readers won't be too interested in them.And I'm not talking about redshirts characters I'm talking about the characters that we will get to grow with during the series.IMO.Armin and jean got the most development in the first 30 chapters, although they are both my least favorite characters.Now around chapter 35 is when the author starts to give focus on the secondary characters.And start to flesh them out more as in making us know their motives and also how they fit in the story/plot overall.There is a few more characters that needs some fleshing out/character development.But overall Isayama is doing a solid job with his character especially in a story driven series.About the female characters, I like how he balance it out as in making both the male and female cast both having important roles in the story.Enjoyment: 10/10.This series is very enjoyable.Not only it has a great story but also it has plenty of action in it that gives me goosebumps.I also like how strategic the fights are in attack on titan especially when it comes to titan vs titan fight.There is no get angry enough and you will win type of fights.Female titan vs eren is a good eg.And I'm not talking about the anime filler with fire titan eren.Or power of friendship defeat the bad guys.If you don't stay calm and think logically you are going to lose.Finding weaknesses and exploiting them is what attack on titan fights are about.Eren vs armored titan is another good eg to that.overall I enjoy the living hell out of this series.The conspiracy, the mystery, the action/horror it all makes this series a series to remember.Overall: 10/10.As I said before, if you want full enjoyment for this series.Re read it.If you are caught up and you're lost on the plot or you just feel you're forgetting things.Just reread it, pay attention and analyze everything.When you reread this series you will notice a lot of things you didn't notice the first time.Its also funny when you're rereading the manga and you know all the traitors in the series.You will also see how suspicious they were.Anyways time to wrap things up.Don't breeze through the chapters when reading it, take your time and enjoy the series for what it's.Whoever that has made it this far, thnx for reading!And I hope you have a wonderful day.Reviewer’s Rating: 10What did you think of this review?Nice              0              Love it              0              Funny              0              Confusing

                                Revenge, compassion, humanity, love.Pointy weapons making minced meat of people.Vinland Saga almost has nothing in common with Makoto Yukimura's previous much praised work, Planetes, except for his passion for technical realism.He grounds his work with research, yet at the same time leaving it open for creative exploration.It’s not dry and lifeless, and at the same time it’s not completely in the realm of fantasy.Vinland saga walks the thin line well.Razor blood soaked thin.This manga is brutal.More brutal than Berserk, Vagabond or anything of that ilk.Not to slight those manga, but one                  ...is a fantasy and the other is an adaptation of a romanticising novel.This manga is brutal because Vinland Saga's atrocities are reality-based and certainly not romanticised, whereas other manga usually are more fantastical or divided clearly between good and bad, right and wrong, black and white, or simply 'here is the protagonist, just root for him'.Not so in Yukimura's love letter to old fashioned beheadings, as Vinland is about Vikings.Vikings pillage villages, they rape and plunder.There is no mercy and no survivors if they can help it.There is no such thing as a Viking displaying the positive nouns mentioned in the first sentence of the review.If Vikings arrive in your village, you will be killed or if you’re extremely lucky sold onto slavery, no matter if you’re young, old, man, woman or child.Based in reality and unflinching, our youthful protagonist, Thorfinn, is a passive-observer to atrocity and active-partaker to violence when it’s in his best interest, to further his goal.Revenge for his father.Yukimura gets Thorfinn's flashback out of the way early in the story, and it’s a good decision as the boy is so fresh-faced, so loveable and innocent; his love for his father so pure, that to suddenly cut from the flashback back to the present and all the while leaving an essential gap in-between; the question that’s on the reader's mind for most of the manga is: how the hell did that young boy end up like this?The flashback provides us with the motivation, the reasoning, but doesn’t reveal the details, the important montage of scenes showing a boy growing up and losing his humanity in the process; we don’t see it seep out of him gradually, which would be fascinating and make for great drama.As of this review, we have yet to see this transition from normal child to adult killer, but I have no doubt Yukimura will provide us with more glimpses of what that boy went through to get to where he is when the story begins.Thorfinn is a jaded efficient killer.Silent and moody, he rarely speaks and when he does he is blunt and to the point.He watches the world burn and die around him without blinking because he is already burnt and dead inside.He can walk past a woman getting beaten and raped without a care in the world; this is the protagonist we're meant to root for.Yukimura doesn’t go all out and have Thorfinn inflict misery on innocents, which would make the manga even more interesting, but would also alienate a large percentage of readers too.As it is, as mentioned earlier, Yukimura walks that thin line with skill.What Vinland Saga is more about than anything else is revenge.It is one of the best ideas to base a story around.Not the 'man on a mission' revenge, but the exploration of the concept, the idea of it all.Yukimura occasionally takes a break from the main story to focus on the concept via random characters, most humorously with a Christian priest who attempts to teach some Vikings about the concept of 'love' which they just don’t get.This side-plot not only explores revenge and forgiveness, but dovetails into Thorfinn's own predicament neatly, forcing him to reflect on what he's doing with his life.The main story follows Thorfinn’s target who he sticks to like glue, always ready to challenge him to a duel to the death, his only requirement for completing his revenge.The brunt of all this rage and inexplicable adherence to honour, is an ambitious man seemingly lacking any of it himself, Askeladd seeks to rise in power through convoluted means and avoids becoming a cliché or a bore.His design is almost amiable at times, with a laid back expression on his cunning face belying his actual ruthful nature to achieve his goals.In short, he is not a one-note villain; he is many faceted like a few characters in the manga.Yukimura flips in and out of actual history through this man’s arc, giving the reader cliffs notes on the politics of the time.The art, to be blunt like an axe disintegrating your face, is fantastic.There is a leap in quality from the first volume to the second, and it is maintained consistently throughout thanks to Yukimura and his budding assistants.There are plenty of memorable action sequences that are staged perfectly; lots of scope and perspective, and the composition is visceral.The violence is in your face and disgusting.Knife and sword thrusts are at times awkwardly landing into skin; fingers are thrust knuckle-deep into eye sockets.It all makes you squirm but you love it because you're reading it in the safety of your own 21st century home.So the violence is remarkably gross and blunt, sometimes gratuitous to please the crowd, but mostly it’s just disgusting.The gore-hounds reading this will love it for that, but everyone else will feel repulsed, but in a good way because this is a story set amid war and conflict in the 11th century.What do you expect, bloodless elbows into the ribs?The story travels around Europe, from Denmark to the UK to Wales to Iceland, we watch the invasion of England affect different players to the drama and pull them in towards each other through interesting means.There are sieges, manhunts, duels, chases, explosive action, edge of your seat tension, backstabs and unexpected partnerships, Vinland Saga has it all and is addictive reading while educating you along the way with its detailed depictions of an old way of life, from clothes, weaponry to customs and traditions.Yukimura yet again uses the manga form to bring readers something a little different, a little more reflective of life outside of the pages.Vinland Saga is a dirty mirror of a past raged by a war not remarkable for its reasons or details, but for the ancient race that battled passionately in it.Vikings.Seriously, don’t mess with them.Reviewer’s Rating: 10What did you think of this review?Nice              0              Love it              0              Funny

right fam!"Almost every update, there's nothing new to fill the table, but dark-horses really like to show up from the shadows.That dark horse may be fairly new, but the bar for the unprecedented potential is there.It may be basically a Mr. and Mrs. Smith approach, but goddamn, it's unique!Spy X Family; a read entertains its readers not just for the aesthetics, but also for the appeal and really comedic story the manga has to offer.Spy X Family basically has two things: 1) No matter what your job is, raising a kid is still the hardest and 2) Every plan can be executed even without a plan.Logically speaking, the manga has believable scenarios especially portraying how underground work works.Developing a nice pace and it's really enjoyable.Also having a kid is a pain in the ass, but having an esper kid?You can plead for help.No action is wasted frame by frame and page to page.The artist is really good at giving life to the work while the readers can follow the story without getting confused.The romance scenes are on the spot with the "sparkles-sparkles" moments and it's basically eye-candy.What else can I say?A moe kid that can do supernatural shit?That what I signed up for!If you are a fan of Saiki, Hinamatsuri, and Mob Psycho, there's no short of supply in terms of comedy in this one.The whole story gave the enjoyment I wanted since I've been reading alot of rom-coms nowadays.Endou Tatsuya, you a f****** god, man.Overall, this is outstandingly impressive.I RECOMMEND THIS PIECE OF ART TO EVERYONE!Reviewer’s Rating: 10What did you think of this review?Nice

Komi-san's cute face.- Cute interactions between Komi-san and Tadano.And between members of the Komi family.- Has pretty relatable situations.- Art is okay.CONS:...- Quite repetitive.- Poor supporting cast, pretty forgettable and inconsistent.Almost no chemistry.- The comedy revolves around Komi-san - unless you relate to her troubles or find her cute, you'll lose interest pretty quickly.MIXED:- Since it's a gag manga, it's understandable that characters have almost no backstory behind their quirks, but it leaves you desiring for more.- Lack of plot.Again, a gag manga.Most favorite moment:Chapter 49 - Hot DayLeast favorite moment:Yamai RenCONCLUSION: Read if you relate or want to relax and have diabetes.Komi-san has a decent meme-abilty.Reviewer’s Rating: 5What did you think of

Dengeki Daisy as I first came across its information page: Another overrated shoujo manga with a simple plot and the cliche catch phrase "I'll protect you".Oh, how wrong was I.Shoujo is known for its obscenely perfect guys as well as the air-headed heroines who fall for them.On the outside, our cast here seems to be no exception.However, the protagonists contain a surprisingly high amount of depth.In essence, we follow the lives of two characters at the same time.Teru, who is cheered on by a text-friend whom she has never met, and Kurosaki, who lives a                  ...double-life of a school janitor and a hacker.Teru is a girl with a strong will and great sense of justice.She also maintains the common sense that shoujo girls tend to lack.Kurosaki protects Teru behind the shadows, both insuring her safety and comforting her when she feels down.Behind his cruel, extortionist attitude, lies a side of him that is kind, determined, and thoughtful.What is really special about this situation is the fact that we know more--yet less--than both of the main characters.The plot is, without a doubt, original.If so, what makes it so special?To put it in simple words, it is the pacing in which the story progresses.While the pace of the manga seems trivial to it's overall enjoyment, it is one of the important elements that make Dengeki Daisy truly great.Instead of a sudden twist that tries to force the readers to gain interest, it discretely leaves us hints and slowly reveals the secrets that we are so dying to know.It does not unveil high amounts of information at a time, and yet it does not make us wait for it.The execution is flawless.In this manga, we start out knowing nothing.Conflicts continue to arise as we are given pieces to a puzzle which will explain just what exactly drives the characters to act as they do.What are DAISY's motivations?How will the character's relationships evolve?What is the truth behind the secret surrounding Teru?For a manga that has so well exceeded many people's expectations so far, there is no doubt that it will continue to deliver a unique and interesting story here on out.Definitely a recommended read.Reviewer’s Rating:

manga list... Well I can tell you that you can find beautiful hidden gems like this.Currently ranked in the top 50s, at first I thought it was “overrated” like many others.I was wrong.Completely.This manga is probably one of the best presentations of the harsh world we live in.The expectations from people for someone to achieve certain goals.The false hope that "something good" may happen at some point.The realization of the hidden thoughts of those around you.Although it is relatively short, this is a very unique manga,                  ...exploring the value of one's life in real money.Intricately planned, it shows how predicting one's life's value can change greatly.The protagonist has lost everything, including friends, money, hobby... And by selling 30 years of his life, he gets 30,000 yen to spend for the 3 months remaining in his life.Usually you would expect the protagonist in a story to improve from how he/she was at the start, to realize and learn his/her mistakes.Or something along those lines.But this is different.Our protagonist has already lost all meaning in life.What he expected to be a rich, vibrant future from when he was 10 years old has turned into a complete disaster.With a boring part-time job and no money... What does he have left to lose when he gets this chance to sell his lifetime and end it early?"You've all been told that it's something that can't be replaced, and that it's more valuable than anything.But if a human life were given a monetary value, how much do you think it would be worth?"This question is basically what the manga is about.It's not whether putting a value is right or not.Rather, it's about how each person would perceive this question depending on what point in their life they are in.It all depends on who you're asking.I think this is the most intriguing part of this work.So why is his "value of life" so low?Borrowing words from the manga, is it really something that depends on "how happy a life it is, how it makes others happy, how many dreams are achieved, how much it contributes to society..."?Another question which is hard to answer.Again, it depends on who you ask.The ambiguity of the value of life can sometimes lead to shocking results.Perhaps it is a warning for us to look at ourselves first, instead of pitying or being annoyed by the protagonist’s nihilistic personality.Overall, the development is very good, perfectly paced throughout the manga and every scene seems to have a deep meaning within.While I read this, I felt as if you could put almost any value to life.The manga wasn't detailed enough in terms of how they give an exact value for one's life.Maybe it's just me but the shop buying lifespan in itself really was a very disturbing existence.How could you put a number just by knowing some info about a person's life?I guess that depends on how you see life, whether every moment should be cherished or only certain moments should.I just can't say how amazing this is... And yet so few people have read it.This is beyond a masterpiece, there's a lot to take in and it really goes in to the basic meaning of life itself.Although for some people this may be boring, with a simple change to make selling lifespan real, the author comes up with this great work.An obvious 10 out of 10.Reviewer’s Rating: 10What did you think of this review?Nice              0              Love it              0              Funny              0              Confusing              0              Informative              0              Well-written              0              Creative              0More reviews by Major_Gilbert (16)            Show allRead moreShow lessOpen              Report Tokidoki(Manga)add        (All reviews)      Nov 1, 2016DoctorWasabiRecommended                 The only One-Shot that has made me cry...No matter how many times I kept rereading it, I still cried every time.From the man who created Nisekoi, brings us  a heart-wrenching tragedy that will surely make you shed a tear once you have completed itWith only 52 pages Komi, Naoshi managed to come up with a story that makes you truly care about the two characters and what they are going through, and what happens to them in the end.If you have 5 free minutes out of your day, then you should read Tokidoki.You won't regret it :)                       Reviewer’s Rating: 9What did you think of this review?Nice              0              Love it              0              Funny              0              Confusing              0              Informative              0              Well-written              0              Creative              0More reviews by DoctorWasabi (1)            Show allRead moreShow lessOpen              Report  PrevNext MoreTop Anime        1Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood2Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Ultra Romantic3Gintama°4Steins;Gate5Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2MoreTop Airing Anime        1Spy x Family Part 22One Piece3Mob Psycho 100 III4Blue Lock5Golden Kamuy 4th SeasonMoreMost Popular Characters        1Lamperouge, Lelouch2Levi3Monkey D., Luffy4Lawliet, L5Roronoa, ZoroHomeAboutPress RoomSupportAdvertisingFAQTermsPrivacyPrivacy SettingsDo Not Sell My Personal InformationCookieNotice at CollectionSitemapLoginSign UpTokyo Otaku ModeHoney's AnimeManga Store      MyAnimeList.net is a property of MyAnimeList Co.,Ltd.©2022 All Rights Reserved.This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.
