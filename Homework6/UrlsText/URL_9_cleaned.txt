Yesterday, 9:52 PMIf you likedTokyo Godfathersadd...then you might likeKotarou wa HitorigurashiaddKotaro Lives Alone and Tokyo Godfathers have sentimental stories that blends comedy and drama and that feature a disparate group of adults taking care of a child under usual circumstances.Kotaro Lives Alone is definitely a hidden gem that is overlooked likely due to the artistic style, but anyone willing to give this anime a chance will find themselves surprised by this touching story.Tokyo Godfathers is a well-known movie, but it is still far less popular compared to any highly rated anime series likely  due to its realistic and mature storyline.I encourage you to consider this recommendation as your next anime if you're interested in found families.reportAnime rec by lancelot200 -

Yesterday, 1:16 AMIf you likedBeckadd...then you might likeAshita no JoeaddThe protagonist from these titles makes his way from the bottom to the top in his profession.The daily life aspect plays an important role.Often, the protagonist gets sidetracked or does odd jobs to stay afloat.On his way, the protagonists meets people from various backgrounds.Especially in Ashita no Joe, I sometimes had the feeling that these people do not fit the stereotypes I usually see on the screen, but reminded me more of people in real life.Whenever I see a character centric real life-ish career story like in Beck, I get reminded of Ashita no Joe.(However, I still have seen no title of this type that I like as much as Ashita no Joe, and Beck is no exception.)reportAnime rec by Estefan - Yesterday, 1:13 AMIf you likedFairy Tailadd...then you might likeBlack CloveraddBlack Clover is set in a fantasy world where magic is an essential part of people's daily lives.Magic guilds, sorcerers and various magic types are all elements that are shared among Fairy Tail and Black Clover.Both series retain a light-hearted, comedic tone that can become dark at times.The main cast are also very similar in terms of personality, but each one has their own goals and dreams to achieve, including each series's protagonist.While Fairy Tail's main focus is on the importance of friendship and bonds to face the hardships of life, Black Clover also emphasizes the fact that no matter your status, skills or abilities, you can achieve anything you want if you try hard enough.This series is highly recommended to Fairy Tail fans and also vice versa.reportAnime rec by ThePhoenix_ - Yesterday, 12:53 AMIf you likedDeaimonadd...then you might likeKumichou Musume to SewagakariaddFirst of all, we focus on the topic.Both has same "babysitting/caretaker" theme.Main protagonists are adult men.The difference is Deaimon guy, Nagomu is carefree while Yakuza's guide to babysitting guy, Tooru is reckless.Both guys takes care of little girl who are not their own biological child.Both series consist of 12 episodes.Same genre, slice of life.Episodic series where mostly, one episode is not related to another episode .Both are heartwarming series although YGTB (I call it that from now) has a bit portion of drama and violence.This is probably due to the title says "Yakuza" in it.Both little girls have similar name, Itsuka (Deaimon), Yaeka (YGTB)Both main guys are popular among female characters either young girls or adult women.Both have run some kind of business or organization.Deaimon for "wagashi" or Japanese sweets/confinement small restaurant and YGTB for Yakuza gang.Both have strict father characters yet they are actually kind.Nagomu's dad (Deaimon), Yaeka's dad (YGTB).reportAnime rec by m_alhafidz -

Oct 7, 2022If you likedKoukyoushihen Eureka Sevenadd...then you might likeTenki no KoaddOn the surface level it does not seem like Eureka 7, an early 2000s mecha anime series, and Weathering with You, a supernatural romance film that came nearly 15 years later, have a lot in common.Despite this I think there are plenty of similarities between the two showsStarting off with our female protagonist Eureka/Hina-Both have a supernatural connection to the environment.-despite their young age both of them are tasked with looking after some (Eureka's 3 orphans and Hina's younger brother).-Both Hina and Eureka's bodies undergo physical changes as the story processes.These changes start on their left arm and slowly spread to the rest of their body.-Both have a symbolic necklace they wear throughout the show.This necklace is broken in the final act.Moving on to the story & themes, the two's story structures are very different, but there are still some important similarities:-Both have heavy environmental/political themes.-the male mc in both (Renton/Hodoka) start off as socially awkward towards their crush but learn to be more confident and caring towards Eureka/Hina at the end.-the climax and final act of the two is nearly identical.-in particular both Renton & Eureka as well as Hina & Hodoka fall from the sky together holding hands.I'll admit I'm bias as these are two of my favorite anime, and there are a great share of differences, but if you like one the other is worth checking out in my opinion.They gave me the same kind of vibe and I hope they will for you too.reportAnime rec by Inter_anime - Oct 7, 2022If you likedHachimitsu to Clover IIadd...then you might likeWorking'!!addWorking explores the side of Japan culture we don’t often see in anime, which is life after high school.Both shows share light undertones of the adult work culture in Japan.Honey and clover does explore relationships and heartache on a deeper level but for the adult slice of life anime they both mesh well reportAnime rec by RellyRel90 -
